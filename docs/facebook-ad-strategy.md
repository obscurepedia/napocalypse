- Allows emotional storytelling (problem → solution → result)
- Higher engagement rates with parent audiences
- Algorithm favors video content
- Feels authentic, not like a polished ad

## Hooks (First 3 Seconds)

Pick one to test first. The hook must stop the scroll instantly by validating their current painful reality.

### Hook 1: The 3am Scroll (Recommended)
> "If you're watching this at 3am while your baby refuses to sleep... I see you."

### Hook 2: The Desperation Validator
> "I tried everything. White noise. Swaddles. Sleep sacks. Nothing worked. Until..."

### Hook 3: The Guilt Reliever
> "Your baby isn't broken. You're not doing it wrong. Here's what's actually happening..."

### Hook 4: The Question Hook
> "What would you give for just ONE full night of sleep?"

### Hook 5: The Relatable Scenario
> "Night 47 of waking up every 2 hours. I was losing my mind..."

### Hook 6: The Controversial Take
> "The number one mistake that's keeping your baby awake? You're trying too hard."

## Image Generator Prompts

### Option 1: Exhausted Parent in Nursery (Recommended)

```
A tired young mother in her late 20s sitting in a dimly lit nursery at night,
soft warm lamplight casting gentle shadows, she's wearing comfortable loungewear
(grey sweatshirt), holding a phone in one hand looking exhausted but hopeful,
a crib visible in the soft-focus background, clock on wall showing 3:17 AM,
empty coffee mug on side table, realistic photography style, shallow depth of field,
warm muted colour palette with soft blues and warm yellows, intimate candid moment,
not posed, authentic emotion, cinematic lighting, 4K quality, lifestyle photography
```

**Why this works for video:**
- Clock can animate (time passing)
- Phone screen can show quiz/text overlay
- Soft lamplight can flicker subtly
- Minimal movement needed (tired stillness is authentic)

---

### Option 2: Raw/Authentic Phone-in-Bed

```
Candid smartphone-style photo of a tired parent in bed at night, phone screen
illuminating their face in blue light, visible dark circles under eyes, messy
hair against pillow, alarm clock on nightstand showing 3:24 AM with red digits,
rumpled white bedding, realistic imperfect lighting like actual night photo,
raw authentic moment, not staged or polished, relatable exhaustion, younger
millennial parent appearance, 4K quality but with slight grain like real phone
photo, intimate vulnerable moment
```

**Why this works for video:**
- Ultra-authentic "I've been there" feeling
- Phone screen is natural place for text overlay
- Clock display can animate/change
- Feels like content, not advertisement

---

### Option 3: Before/After Split

```
Split screen image, LEFT SIDE: exhausted parent with dark circles under eyes,
disheveled hair, dim 3am lighting, messy nursery background, stressed expression,
holding crying baby symbol (could be toy or shadow). RIGHT SIDE: same parent but
well-rested, soft morning light streaming through window, peaceful sleeping baby
in crib background, genuine relieved smile, neat appearance. Warm colour palette,
realistic photography style, lifestyle photo, authentic not staged, soft focus
backgrounds, emotional contrast between sides, 4K quality, horizontal composition
suitable for social media
```

---

### Option 4: Peaceful Destination (Aspirational)

```
Serene nursery scene at dawn, soft golden morning light streaming through sheer
curtains, peaceful sleeping baby in modern crib, parent visible in doorway
silhouette holding warm cup of coffee, looking at baby with relief and love,
calm atmosphere, soft neutral colour palette with warm sunrise tones, clean
modern nursery decor, realistic photography, shallow depth of field focusing
on crib, sense of peace and accomplishment, aspirational but achievable feeling,
4K quality, cinematic composition, lifestyle photography style
```

---

### Option 5: The Google Search POV

```
Over-the-shoulder view of tired parent's hands holding smartphone in dark room
at night, phone screen showing blurry search results for "why won't my baby sleep",
soft blue phone glow on hands and partial face reflection, background showing
blurred nursery with dim nightlight, intimate POV perspective, realistic phone
screen content, exhausted body language in posture, late night atmosphere,
modern smartphone, authentic moment of desperation and searching for answers,
4K quality, shallow depth of field, moody low-light photography
```

## Video Generator Prompts

### For the Nursery/Exhausted Mom Image

```
Subtle gentle movement. The lamp light softly flickers. Steam rises slowly from
the coffee mug. The mother blinks tiredly and takes a slow breath. Her thumb
scrolls slightly on the phone screen. Very minimal movement, calm and quiet
late-night atmosphere. Camera stays completely still. Slow, dreamy pacing.
```

### For the Phone-in-Bed Image

```
The phone screen glows and flickers subtly as if scrolling. The person blinks
slowly, exhausted. The alarm clock digits remain steady. Minimal movement -
just tired breathing and the soft blue phone glow illuminating their face.
No camera movement. Quiet, intimate, 3am feeling. Slow motion feel.
```

### Key Animation Modifiers (Add to Any Prompt)

```
Slow, subtle movement only. No dramatic motion. Camera locked/static.
Cinematic, quiet atmosphere. Loop-friendly ending. 4-6 seconds duration.
