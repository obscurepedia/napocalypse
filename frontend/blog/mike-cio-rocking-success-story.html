                <p><strong>Mike's Situation:</strong> His 6-month-old son, Jake, would only fall asleep while being rocked. Not just a little rocking - we're talking 30-45 minutes of vigorous bouncing on a yoga ball. Every. Single. Time. Mike's back was killing him, his arms were sore, and Jake was waking 3-4 times per night needing to be rocked back to sleep each time.</p>

            <h2>The Breaking Point</h2>
            
            <p>"I felt like a human rocking chair," Mike told me. "My back was in constant pain. I'd spend 2-3 hours a day just bouncing on that damn yoga ball."</p>
            
            <p>Mike's breaking point came when he threw out his back during a 2am rocking session. He literally couldn't stand up straight for three days.</p>
            
            <p>"I realized this wasn't sustainable," Mike said. "I couldn't keep doing this for months. Something had to change."</p>
            
            <h2>The 6-Day Journey</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Night 1:</strong> Jake cried for 50 minutes. Mike almost caved at minute 40. His wife had to physically stop him from going in.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Night 2:</strong> 40 minutes of crying. Progress, but still brutal to listen to.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Night 3:</strong> 30 minutes of crying, but Jake woke 5 times (extinction burst). Mike was ready to give up.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Night 4:</strong> Only 15 minutes at bedtime. Then Jake slept for 5 hours straight. Mike's breakthrough moment.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Night 5:</strong> 10 minutes of fussing. Slept 7 hours straight.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Night 6:</strong> Jake went down with minimal protest. Slept 9 hours straight.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Night 7:</strong> No crying at all. Mike put Jake in the crib awake, walked out, and Jake fell asleep on his own within 5 minutes.</p>
            
            <h2>The Results</h2>
            
            <p>Within 2 weeks, Jake was sleeping 11-12 hours straight. Mike's back pain disappeared. His evenings were his own again.</p>
            
            <p>"I wish I'd done this months ago," Mike said. "We were both suffering because I thought he NEEDED the rocking. He didn't. He just needed to learn a new skill."</p>
