<strong>Published:</strong> January 2024 | <strong>Reading Time:</strong> 8 minutes | <strong>Method:</strong> Cry-It-Out

<p>---</p>

<h2>The 5 AM Alarm Clock (That Wouldn't Turn Off)</h2>

<p>Tom was living every parent's nightmare: his 9-month-old daughter, Maya, woke up at 5:00 AM. Every. Single. Day.</p>

<p>Not 6:00 AM. Not 6:30 AM. Exactly 5:00 AM, like clockwork.</p>

<p>"I'm a software engineer who works from home," Tom told me. "My workday starts at 9 AM. I thought having a baby would mean I could sleep until 7:00 or 7:30, then have a leisurely morning before work. Instead, I was up at 5 AM every day, exhausted and resentful."</p>

<p>The early wake-ups affected everything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tom was chronically sleep-deprived (going to bed at 11 PM, up at 5 AM = 6 hours max)</li>
<li>His wife was exhausted (they took turns, but both were suffering)</li>
<li>Maya was cranky by 8 AM (she needed more sleep too)</li>
<li>Tom's work performance was declining (brain fog from lack of sleep)</li>
<li>Weekend mornings were ruined (no sleeping in, ever)</li>
</ul>

<p>"I felt trapped," Tom said. "I'd read that babies 'naturally' wake up early, so I thought I just had to accept it. But 5 AM felt cruel."</p>

<h2>Why Early Morning Wake-Ups Are So Stubborn</h2>

<p>Here's what Tom didn't understand: <strong>5 AM wake-ups aren't natural—they're usually a sleep association problem.</strong></p>

<p>Maya's sleep pattern looked like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bedtime: 7:00 PM</li>
<li>Sleep through until 5:00 AM (10 hours)</li>
<li>Wake up crying</li>
<li>Tom or his wife would go in, try to soothe her back to sleep</li>
<li>Sometimes it worked (for 30 minutes), usually it didn't</li>
<li>By 5:30 AM, they'd give up and start the day</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem? Maya had learned that 5 AM = "time to get up and see my parents."</p>

<strong>What was happening biologically:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Maya's sleep drive was lowest at 5 AM (after 10 hours of sleep)</li>
<li>She'd partially wake up (normal sleep cycle transition)</li>
<li>She'd realize she was alone and cry</li>
<li>Parents would come in (reinforcing the wake-up)</li>
<li>Even if they didn't pick her up, their presence signaled "it's morning time"</li>
</ul>

<p>This created a vicious cycle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maya wakes at 5 AM (partial arousal)</li>
<li>Parents respond (teaching her this is wake-up time)</li>
<li>Maya's body clock adjusts to expect wake-up at 5 AM</li>
<li>The pattern becomes entrenched</li>
<li>Repeat every single day</li>
</ol>

<p>"I didn't realize we were training her to wake up at 5 AM," Tom said. "Every time we went in, we were basically saying 'yes, this is an acceptable time to start the day.' But we were too tired to think clearly about it."</p>

<h2>The Breaking Point: A Sleep Consultant's Advice</h2>

<p>After 4 months of 5 AM wake-ups, Tom's wife found a sleep consultant's blog post about early morning wake-ups. The consultant's advice was blunt:</p>

<strong>"Stop responding to early wake-ups. Your baby is capable of sleeping until 6:30-7:00 AM. You're teaching her to wake up early by going in."</strong>

<p>The blog post explained:</p>
<ul>
<li>Babies 9+ months can sleep 11-12 hours straight</li>
<li>Early morning wake-ups are usually behavioral, not biological</li>
<li>The solution is to stop reinforcing the wake-up time</li>
<li>Use CIO to teach the baby to fall back asleep independently</li>
</ul>

<p>Tom was skeptical. "We'd tried ignoring her before. She'd just scream for an hour, and we'd feel terrible. How was this different?"</p>

<p>The key difference: <strong>consistency and commitment.</strong></p>

<p>"We'd tried ignoring her for 10-15 minutes, then give up," Tom realized. "We never committed to a full plan. We'd cave when she escalated, which taught her that screaming louder would get us to come in."</p>

<h2>Tom's Decision: Why He Chose CIO for Early Mornings</h2>

<p>Tom had tried other approaches for 4 months:</p>

<strong>What didn't work:</strong>
<ul>
<li>❌ Earlier bedtime (made wake-ups even earlier)</li>
<li>❌ Later bedtime (made her overtired, didn't change wake time)</li>
<li>❌ Dream feed at 10 PM (she wasn't hungry)</li>
<li>❌ Blackout curtains (room was already pitch black)</li>
<li>❌ White noise (already using it)</li>
<li>❌ Going in to soothe (reinforced the wake-up)</li>
<li>❌ Ignoring for 10-15 minutes then giving up (inconsistent)</li>
</ul>

<p>"I'd tried everything except actually committing to a plan," Tom said. "I was desperate. I needed something that would actually work."</p>

<p>Three factors convinced him to try CIO:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Medical clearance:</strong> Pediatrician confirmed Maya was healthy and capable of sleeping longer</li>
<li><strong>Failed alternatives:</strong> 4 months of trying everything else</li>
<li><strong>Quality of life:</strong> The entire family was suffering from chronic sleep deprivation</li>
</ol>

<p>"I realized that continuing to wake up at 5 AM every day for years wasn't sustainable," Tom said. "Something had to change, and I needed to be the one to change it."</p>

<h2>Tom's 10-Day CIO Plan for Early Mornings</h2>

<p>Tom used a modified extinction approach specifically for early morning wake-ups. Here's exactly what he did:</p>

<h3>The Rules:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wake time is 6:30 AM</strong> (non-negotiable)</li>
<li><strong>Do not enter the room before 6:30 AM</strong> (no matter what)</li>
<li><strong>At 6:30 AM, enter with enthusiasm</strong> ("Good morning! It's time to wake up!")</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent every single day</strong> (including weekends)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Day 1-3: The Hardest Days</h3>

<strong>Day 1:</strong>
<ul>
<li>5:00 AM: Maya woke up crying</li>
<li>Tom and his wife stayed in bed (listening on the monitor)</li>
<li>Maya cried for 52 minutes</li>
<li>At 5:52 AM, she fell back asleep</li>
<li>At 6:30 AM, Tom entered the room and woke her up cheerfully</li>
</ul>

<p>"That was brutal," Tom admitted. "52 minutes of crying felt like an eternity. But we'd committed to the plan, so we stuck with it."</p>

<strong>Day 2:</strong>
<ul>
<li>5:05 AM: Maya woke up crying</li>
<li>Cried for 45 minutes</li>
<li>Fell back asleep at 5:50 AM</li>
<li>Tom woke her at 6:30 AM</li>
</ul>

<strong>Day 3:</strong>
<ul>
<li>5:10 AM: Maya woke up crying</li>
<li>Cried for 38 minutes</li>
<li>Fell back asleep at 5:48 AM</li>
<li>Tom woke her at 6:30 AM</li>
</ul>

<p>"I could see the pattern," Tom said. "The crying was decreasing each day. She was learning."</p>

<h3>Day 4-6: The Breakthrough</h3>

<strong>Day 4:</strong>
<ul>
<li>5:15 AM: Maya woke up fussing (not full crying)</li>
<li>Fussed for 22 minutes</li>
<li>Fell back asleep at 5:37 AM</li>
<li>Tom woke her at 6:30 AM</li>
</ul>

<strong>Day 5:</strong>
<ul>
<li>5:20 AM: Maya woke up, fussed for 15 minutes</li>
<li>Fell back asleep at 5:35 AM</li>
<li>Tom woke her at 6:30 AM</li>
</ul>

<strong>Day 6:</strong>
<ul>
<li>5:25 AM: Maya woke up, fussed for 8 minutes</li>
<li>Fell back asleep at 5:33 AM</li>
<li>Tom woke her at 6:30 AM</li>
</ul>

<p>"By Day 6, I was amazed," Tom said. "She was waking up later each day, and the fussing was minimal. Her body clock was adjusting."</p>

<h3>Day 7-10: The New Normal</h3>

<strong>Day 7:</strong>
<ul>
<li>5:40 AM: Maya woke up, fussed for 5 minutes</li>
<li>Fell back asleep at 5:45 AM</li>
<li>Tom woke her at 6:30 AM</li>
</ul>

<strong>Day 8:</strong>
<ul>
<li>6:00 AM: Maya woke up, played quietly in her crib</li>
<li>Tom entered at 6:30 AM</li>
<li>Maya was happy and babbling</li>
</ul>

<strong>Day 9:</strong>
<ul>
<li>6:15 AM: Maya woke up, played quietly</li>
<li>Tom entered at 6:30 AM</li>
</ul>

<strong>Day 10:</strong>
<ul>
<li>6:30 AM: Maya woke up naturally right at wake time</li>
<li>Tom entered immediately</li>
<li>Maya was happy and well-rested</li>
</ul>

<p>"Day 10 was magical," Tom said. "She woke up at exactly 6:30 AM, happy and ready to start the day. No crying, no fussing. Just a well-rested baby waking up at a reasonable time."</p>

<h2>The Results: 3 Months Later</h2>

<p>When I followed up with Tom 3 months after his CIO success, here's what he reported:</p>

<strong>Wake time stats:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Typical wake time: 6:20-6:40 AM (vs. 5:00 AM before)</li>
<li>Tom enters room at 6:30 AM every day</li>
<li>Maya is happy and well-rested</li>
<li>No more early morning crying</li>
</ul>

<strong>Sleep quality:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Total night sleep: 11-11.5 hours (vs. 10 hours before)</li>
<li>Maya is getting the sleep she needs</li>
<li>Naps improved too (less overtired)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Quality of life changes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"I feel like a human again. Getting up at 6:30 instead of 5:00 makes a huge difference."</li>
<li>"I'm more productive at work. I can actually think clearly."</li>
<li>"Weekends are enjoyable again. We can have a leisurely morning."</li>
<li>"My wife and I are both happier and less resentful."</li>
</ul>

<strong>The skill stuck:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Maya has maintained 6:30 AM wake time for 3 months</li>
<li>Even during time changes and travel, she adjusts back quickly</li>
<li>Occasional early wake-ups (during illness) resolve within 1-2 days</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why CIO Works So Well for Early Morning Wake-Ups</h2>

<p>Here's what makes CIO particularly effective for fixing early morning wake-ups:</p>

<strong>1. It breaks the reinforcement cycle:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Early wake-ups are often behavioral (learned pattern)</li>
<li>Responding to early wake-ups reinforces them</li>
<li>Not responding teaches baby to fall back asleep</li>
</ul>

<strong>2. It resets the body clock:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Consistent wake time trains the circadian rhythm</li>
<li>Body learns when "morning" actually is</li>
<li>Sleep drive adjusts to support longer sleep</li>
</ul>

<strong>3. It's faster than gradual approaches:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gradual wake time shifting can take 6-8 weeks</li>
<li>CIO typically works in 7-14 days</li>
<li>Less total crying over the long term</li>
</ul>

<strong>4. It creates lasting change:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Once the body clock resets, it stays reset</li>
<li>Baby maintains the new wake time naturally</li>
<li>No need to constantly "retrain"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Concerns Tom Had (And How He Handled Them)</h2>

<h3>"What if she's hungry?"</h3>
<p>Tom's pediatrician confirmed Maya didn't need night feeds at 9 months. "If she was truly hungry, she'd wake up at different times, not exactly 5 AM every day. The consistency proved it was behavioral, not hunger."</p>

<h3>"What if she's in pain or sick?"</h3>
<p>"I could tell the difference," Tom said. "Her 5 AM cry was her 'I'm awake and want attention' cry, not her 'I'm in pain' cry. If she'd been sick or in pain, I would've gone in immediately."</p>

<h3>"Isn't 6:30 AM still early?"</h3>
<p>"It's a compromise," Tom said. "Ideally I'd love 7:00 or 7:30 AM, but 6:30 is realistic for a baby. It gives me time to shower and have coffee before work. And it's 90 minutes later than 5:00 AM, which is life-changing."</p>

<h3>"What about daylight saving time?"</h3>
<p>"We adjusted gradually over 3-4 days," Tom said. "Shifted wake time by 15 minutes each day. Maya adapted easily because she'd learned the skill of sleeping until wake time."</p>

<h3>"What if she wakes up before 6:30 but doesn't cry?"</h3>
<p>"If she's playing quietly in her crib, I still wait until 6:30 to go in," Tom said. "That reinforces that 6:30 is wake time, not whenever she happens to wake up."</p>

<h2>Tom's Advice for Parents with Early Wake-Ups</h2>

<strong>1. Make sure it's actually a problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some babies are naturally early risers (6:00-6:30 AM is normal)</li>
<li>If your baby wakes at 5:00 AM or earlier, it's worth addressing</li>
<li>If everyone is happy with the wake time, don't fix what isn't broken</li>
</ul>

<strong>2. Rule out other issues first:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Room too bright (use blackout curtains)</li>
<li>Room too cold/hot (ideal is 68-72°F)</li>
<li>Hunger (but unlikely if baby is 9+ months and eating well)</li>
<li>Bedtime too early or too late</li>
</ul>

<strong>3. Choose a realistic wake time:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Don't aim for 8:00 AM if your baby is waking at 5:00 AM. Start with 6:30-7:00 AM."</li>
</ul>

<strong>4. Be absolutely consistent:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Same wake time every single day, including weekends. Consistency is everything."</li>
</ul>

<strong>5. Don't enter the room early:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Even if your baby stops crying, wait until wake time to go in. Otherwise you're teaching them that crying gets you to come in faster."</li>
</ul>

<strong>6. Enter with enthusiasm at wake time:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Make wake time special. Open curtains, turn on lights, be cheerful. This teaches baby that THIS is morning time."</li>
</ul>

<strong>7. Give it 10-14 days:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Don't judge progress after 3-4 days. It takes time for the body clock to reset."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is CIO Right for Your Early Morning Wake-Up Situation?</h2>

<p>CIO worked brilliantly for Tom's early morning wake-ups, but it's not the only option. Consider CIO if:</p>

<p>✅ Your baby is 9+ months old  </p>
<p>✅ Wake-ups are consistently before 6:00 AM  </p>
<p>✅ You've ruled out hunger, discomfort, and environmental issues  </p>
<p>✅ Gentle approaches haven't worked after 3-4 weeks  </p>
<p>✅ You're comfortable with some crying during learning  </p>
<p>✅ You can commit to consistency for 10-14 days  </p>
<p>✅ Your baby can self-soothe at bedtime (if not, train that first)  </p>

<p>CIO might NOT be right if:</p>

<p>❌ Your baby is under 9 months  </p>
<p>❌ Wake-ups are inconsistent (different times each day)  </p>
<p>❌ Your baby is hungry (still needs night feeds)  </p>
<p>❌ You haven't ruled out environmental issues  </p>
<p>❌ You're not emotionally ready for crying  </p>
<p>❌ You can't be consistent (due to work schedule, etc.)  </p>

<h2>Ready to End Those Early Morning Wake-Ups?</h2>

<p>Tom's story shows that fixing early morning wake-ups with CIO can work quickly and create lasting change. Ten days of training led to months of sleeping until 6:30 AM.</p>
