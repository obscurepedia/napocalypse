## Night Weaning for the Frequent Waker

Since you've been waking every 1-2 hours, night feeding is likely a big part of why.

**Here's what's happening:**
- Your baby's body learned to expect frequent calories
- They wake "hungry" even though they don't need the nutrition
- Feeding is how they fall back asleep

**Why this matters for you especially:**
- Frequent feeding = frequent waking
- The two reinforce each other
- Breaking this cycle may be the key to long stretches

**The approach:**
- Night weaning is likely a major piece of your puzzle
- Consider the 5/3/3 rule to gradually space feeds out
- Apply your method to any wake before the feed is "allowed"

**What to expect:**
- They'll be confused/mad the first few nights
- The early-night stretches should lengthen first
- Within a week, you should see major improvement

**The payoff:**
- Going from 5-6 feeds to 0-1 changes everything
- Your baby learns night is for sleeping
- You finally get consecutive hours of sleep

This might be the single biggest change that gets you long stretches. Commit to it.
