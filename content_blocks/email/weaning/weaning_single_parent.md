## Night Weaning Solo

Night weaning alone adds an extra layer - you're the only one responding, and you can't trade off.

**What to know:**
- It's physically demanding (you're up AND not feeding)
- It's emotionally demanding (no one to reassure you)
- It's absolutely doable

**Your strategy:**
- Pick a night when you can recover the next day
- Have everything prepped: water for you, timer, phone on silent
- Choose the gradual approach if cold turkey feels too hard solo

**The challenge:**
- When you're exhausted and baby is crying, feeding is EASY
- That's why it's hard to break
- You need to be committed before you start

**Helpful reminders:**
- This is temporary (3-7 nights)
- You're not starving your baby (they can eat during the day)
- Every night of consistency shortens the process

**Your advantage:**
- 100% consistency (no partner with different approach)
- You know your baby best
- Once done, YOU get the sleep benefit

It's harder without a partner. But you've already proven you can handle hard things.
