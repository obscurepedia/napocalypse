## Night Weaning at 7+ Months: You're Ready

At this age, your baby almost certainly doesn't need those night feeds nutritionally. Their body has just learned to expect calories at those times.

**Why the wake-ups happen:**
- Conditioned hunger: body wakes at the "usual" time
- Habit: feeding is the path back to sleep
- Not actual caloric need

**The goal:**
Shift those calories to daytime so their body stops expecting them at night.

**Your approach options (detailed above):**
1. Gradual reduction (time/amount)
2. 5/3/3 rule (feed only after certain intervals)

**What to expect:**
- They'll wake at the "usual" times for a few nights
- Apply your method instead of feeding
- Within 5-7 nights, the habit wakes should stop

**Daytime adjustments:**
- Add an extra feed during the day
- Bulk up dinner and bedtime feed
- Make sure they're getting enough calories before nighttime

Your baby can get all their calories during the day. Night weaning teaches their body that night is for sleeping, not eating.
