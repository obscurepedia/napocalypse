## Night Weaning at 4-6 Months: Proceed Carefully

At this age, night weaning is a "maybe" - your baby may still genuinely need calories overnight.

**Before you night wean:**
- Check with your pediatrician
- Make sure baby is gaining weight appropriately
- Confirm they're eating enough during the day

**If pediatrician says yes:**
- Use the gradual approach (reduce time/amount slowly)
- Don't go cold turkey with a young baby
- Watch for signs of genuine hunger

**If pediatrician says not yet:**
- Keep 1-2 night feeds as needed
- Focus on the feed-to-sleep association instead
- Put baby down awake AFTER the feed

**The priority at this age:**
- Independent sleep skills first
- Night weaning second (when developmentally ready)
- Don't rush it

Some 4-6 month olds can night wean. Others need more time. Follow your pediatrician's guidance.
