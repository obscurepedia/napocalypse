## Managing Well-Meaning Grandparents

They love your baby. They want to help. And they might undo everything you've worked for.

**The script you need:**
"We've worked really hard on teaching [baby] to sleep independently. I know it's hard to hear them fuss, but it's part of their learning. Please don't pick them up or rock them to sleep - they'll settle in a few minutes."

**Firm but kind. Not negotiable.**

**Before the visit:**
- Explain your approach (briefly)
- Share the "rules": no rocking to sleep, no rescuing from crib
- Ask them to trust you on this

**During the visit:**
- Do bedtime yourself if possible
- If they insist on helping, give them the routine script
- Be prepared to step in if they deviate

**If they don't listen:**
- You may need to do a mini-reset after they leave
- It won't take as long as the first time
- Your baby hasn't forgotten the skills

**The balance:**
- You can accept help with other things
- But sleep is your domain right now
- They'll appreciate it when everyone is well-rested

Your baby. Your rules. Grandparents get to love them, not override you.
