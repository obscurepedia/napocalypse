## Managing Disruptions with a Sibling in the Room

When life happens (illness, travel, visitors), it affects BOTH kids in a shared room.

**During the disruption:**
- Consider temporary separation if one child is sick
- Explain to the older child what's happening
- Keep their routine as normal as possible

**Protecting the older child:**
- White noise helps mask baby sounds
- Keep their bedtime consistent
- Most kids sleep through more than you think

**After the disruption:**
- Get back to normal routine immediately
- Both kids may need a reset
- Do it on a weekend if possible

**Common scenarios:**

**Baby is sick:**
- Older child can stay in room
- Baby may need extra comfort (that's okay)
- Reset baby's sleep when healthy

**Travel with shared rooms:**
- Stick to home routine as much as possible
- Same bedtime, same order
- White noise travels well

**Visitors disrupting schedule:**
- Be firm about bedtime for both kids
- Stagger as usual
- Don't let visitor presence extend bedtime

Two kids in one room means you guard that sleep fiercely.
