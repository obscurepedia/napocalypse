## Maintaining Sleep During Work Travel

Travel for work means someone else is doing bedtime. That's a variable you can't fully control - but you can prepare for it.

**Before you leave:**
- Walk your partner/caregiver through the exact routine
- Write it down (seriously, write it down)
- Explain the method and the "why"
- Stress: consistency matters more than perfection

**What to communicate:**
- Wake windows and nap schedule
- Bedtime routine steps (in order)
- What to do if baby wakes
- What NOT to do (no old crutches)

**While you're gone:**
- Check in, but don't micromanage
- Trust that your system works even with small variations
- Expect some regression when you return (it's normal)

**When you get back:**
- Immediately return to your usual approach
- Don't be surprised if baby tests you
- It usually takes 1-2 nights to get back on track

**The reassurance:**
- Your baby won't "forget" how to sleep in a few days
- Consistency from the other caregiver helps
- You can reset quickly when you're home

Work travel disrupts things. But your foundation is strong.
