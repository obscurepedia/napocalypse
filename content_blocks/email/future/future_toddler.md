## What's Ahead: Your Toddler's Sleep Future

At 13+ months, here's what you can expect in the coming months:

**Upcoming transitions:**
- **2-to-1 nap transition** (if not done yet): Usually happens 13-18 months
- **Crib to bed**: Usually 2.5-3 years (don't rush this!)
- **18-month sleep regression**: Testing boundaries, language explosion
- **2-year sleep regression**: Imagination, fears, more testing

**How to handle what's coming:**
- Same approach you've used: consistency wins
- Toddlers are boundary testers - that's their job
- Hold your limits with calm confidence
- Expect periodic testing (it's developmental)

**What to watch for:**
- Climbing out of crib (lower mattress, consider sleep sack)
- Stalling tactics at bedtime (water, potty, one more hug)
- Nighttime fears (usually emerges around 2+)

**Your advantage:**
- You've already established independent sleep
- You know consistency works
- Toddlers remember the rules even when they test them

The foundation you've built will serve your toddler through all of it. You have the skills.
