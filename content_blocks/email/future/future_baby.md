## What's Ahead: Your Baby's Sleep Future

At 4-12 months, here's what you can expect in the coming months:

**Upcoming transitions:**
- **Nap transitions**: 4 to 3 naps (around 5-6 months), 3 to 2 naps (around 7-8 months)
- **Sleep regressions**: 8-10 months (separation anxiety), 12 months (developmental)
- **Wake window changes**: They'll stretch as your baby gets older
- **Night weaning**: When your pediatrician gives the green light

**How to handle what's coming:**
- Same approach: consistency wins
- Regressions are temporary - hold the line
- Adjust wake windows gradually as baby grows
- Trust the foundation you've built

**What to watch for:**
- Signs of nap transition (fighting a nap, longer wake windows)
- Separation anxiety peak (8-10 months)
- Standing in crib (they'll do this - lay down once, then leave)

**Your advantage:**
- Independent sleep skills are established
- You know your method works
- Your baby has the foundation for all future sleep

The skill you've taught your baby will serve them through every regression, transition, and phase. You've set them up for success.
