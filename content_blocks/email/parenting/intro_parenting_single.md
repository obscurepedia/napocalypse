## A Note for Single Parents

I see you. Doing this alone - every wake-up, every decision, every 3 AM moment of doubt - takes a different kind of strength.

Here's what I need you to know: This program is designed to be manageable for one person. You don't need a partner to tap out to. You don't need backup at 2 AM. You can do this.

**What to expect:**
- The process is exactly the same, just without the relay race option
- Give yourself extra grace - you're doing the work of two people
- Lean on daytime support if you have it (family, friends, daycare)
- Prioritize YOUR sleep recovery once this is working

You're not at a disadvantage. You're just proving you can handle hard things solo. Which, honestly, you already knew.
