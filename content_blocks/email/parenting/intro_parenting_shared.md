## Working Together: The Partner Advantage

Having a partner in this means you can divide and conquer - but only if you're on the same page.

**Before tonight, make sure you both agree on:**
- The method you're using (and why)
- Who handles which wake-ups
- What "consistency" looks like for your family
- A signal for when one person needs a tap-out

**The tag-team approach works well:**
- One parent does bedtime, the other does night wakings
- Or alternate nights completely
- The key: whoever responds needs to use the same approach

Mixed signals = confused baby = longer process. Get aligned now, thank me later.
