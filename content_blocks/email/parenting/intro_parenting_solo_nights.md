## When One Parent Does Nights

You're handling the night shift solo - whether by choice or circumstance. That's totally workable, but it means you need to be extra strategic.

**Set yourself up for success:**
- Communicate the plan clearly to your partner (so they don't undermine it)
- Have a "tap-out" protocol for your hardest nights
- Prioritize your sleep recovery during the day when possible
- Don't compare your load to families with shared nights

**The upside:** Consistency is easier when one person is in charge. Your baby learns faster because there's no variation in response.

You've got this. And when the nights improve, you'll be the hero who made it happen.
