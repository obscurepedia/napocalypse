## At 4-6 Months: The Perfect Time to Start

Here's the good news: you're starting at the ideal window. At 4-6 months, your baby's sleep architecture is maturing, their circadian rhythm is developing, and they're neurologically ready to learn independent sleep.

**What this means for you:**
- Your baby CAN learn to self-soothe
- Night sleep usually improves first (within 3-5 nights)
- Naps take longer but will follow
- You may still need 1-2 night feeds (totally normal)

This is the age where consistency pays off fast. Trust the process.
