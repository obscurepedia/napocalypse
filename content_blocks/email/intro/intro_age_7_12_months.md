## At 7-12 Months: You've Got This

Your baby is developmentally ready for this. At this age, they're capable of sleeping long stretches, their stomach can hold enough food to get through the night, and they're smart enough to learn new patterns quickly.

**What this means for you:**
- Results often come within 3-5 nights
- Your baby may protest more vocally (they're opinionated now!)
- Separation anxiety might be peaking - this is normal
- Night feeds are likely habit, not hunger

Your baby's ready. Now it's about giving them the chance to show you what they can do.
