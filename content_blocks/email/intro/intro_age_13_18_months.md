## At 13-18 Months: Toddler Territory

Your toddler understands more than you think. They know the bedtime routine. They know what comes next. And yes, they know exactly how to push your buttons at 2 AM.

**What this means for you:**
- They may test boundaries harder (this is developmentally normal)
- Language explosion can temporarily disrupt sleep
- They're dropping to 1 nap (or about to)
- Standing in the crib is common - don't make it a game

The good news? Toddlers are creatures of habit. Once you establish the new rules, they'll follow them. You just need to be more consistent than they are persistent.
