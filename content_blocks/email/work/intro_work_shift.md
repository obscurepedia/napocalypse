## For Shift Workers

Irregular hours make sleep training trickier - but not impossible. Your baby CAN learn to sleep independently even if your schedule varies.

**The key adjustments:**
- Keep your BABY's schedule consistent, even when yours isn't
- Designate one "sleep trained" location (the crib) and stick to it
- Communicate the plan to anyone who cares for baby during your shifts
- Accept some flexibility - you're working with more variables

**What to prioritize:**
- Baby's bedtime stays the same (even if you're not home)
- Same routine, same approach, no matter who's doing it
- Your off-days are your best training opportunities

It's harder with shift work. I won't pretend otherwise. But your baby can absolutely learn this - you just need extra coordination.
