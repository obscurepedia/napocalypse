## For Stay-at-Home Parents

Being home all day with your baby means you see every nap struggle, every overtired meltdown, every moment of sleep deprivation's impact.

**The advantage:** You have full control over the schedule. No daycare pickups, no nanny handoffs, no variables.

**The challenge:** There's no escape. You're in the trenches 24/7.

**What to focus on:**
- Protect those nap times fiercely (even if you have to decline plans)
- Create a "shift end" ritual for yourself (even a 10-minute break)
- Your sleep matters too - prioritize rest when baby sleeps

You're not "just" staying home. You're building the foundation for everything else.
