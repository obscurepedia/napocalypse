## For Working Parents

I know you're running on empty. You're waking up exhausted, surviving on coffee, pushing through meetings, and coming home to do it all again.

**Here's the truth:** You need this to work even more than most, because functioning at work on broken sleep isn't sustainable.

**What to focus on:**
- Be aggressive with the timeline - don't drag this out
- Communicate the plan to your childcare provider (consistency matters there too)
- Accept that this week might be rough at work - but next week will be better
- Prioritize this over other obligations temporarily

The goal: within 1-2 weeks, you'll be sleeping well enough to actually think clearly at work again. That's not selfish - that's survival.
