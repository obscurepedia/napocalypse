## Wins for the Working Parent

Here's what progress looks like when you're surviving work on broken sleep:

**Celebrate if:**
- You got through a workday without feeling like a zombie
- You had enough brain power for an actual conversation
- You didn't need 4 coffees to function
- You had energy left for bedtime routine

**Why these matter:**
- You need functional sleep to do your job
- Exhaustion affects everything: mood, decisions, safety
- This isn't just about baby - it's about you surviving

**What you're working toward:**
- Walking into work rested
- Actually thinking clearly in meetings
- Having something left for your family after work

**Perspective:**
- Even ONE better night improves your next day
- Sleep compounds: better night = better day = better bedtime = better night
- You're breaking the cycle

**What victory looks like for you:**
- Feeling rested (or at least functional)
- Not dreading bedtime because you know it works
- Having actual evening time after baby sleeps

You need this more than most. You're almost there.
