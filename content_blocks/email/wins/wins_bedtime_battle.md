## Wins for the Bedtime Battler

If bedtime used to take an hour (or more), here's what progress looks like:

**Celebrate if:**
- Bedtime took less time than before
- Your baby fell asleep without the old routine (rocking, feeding)
- There was less crying than the first night
- You finished the routine and walked away

**Why these matter:**
- Bedtime is the foundation for everything else
- Quick, calm bedtimes = better overall sleep
- Less battle energy = more parent sanity

**Signs of progress:**
- Less protest when you leave the room
- Faster settling
- You're not doing 17 interventions before they sleep

**The timeline:**
- Nights 1-3: Still a battle, but you're holding the line
- Nights 4-7: Should see noticeable reduction
- Week 2: Most bedtime battles resolve

**What victory looks like for you:**
- Routine to asleep in under 30 minutes
- Put them down, walk away, done
- Actually having your evenings back

If bedtime is getting even slightly easier, you're making progress. Keep going.
