## Wins for the Early Morning Waker

If your baby was waking at 4 or 5 AM, here's what progress looks like:

**Celebrate if:**
- Wake-up time moved even 15 minutes later
- They stirred at 5 but went back to sleep until 6
- You successfully treated the early wake as a night waking
- They slept until 6 AM (even once!)

**Why these matter:**
- Early mornings are the LAST thing to improve
- Any shift later is a win
- Treating early wakes correctly breaks the habit

**Realistic expectations:**
- Night wakings often resolve before early mornings
- Early mornings can take 2-3 weeks
- Progress may be 10-15 minutes at a time

**What's happening:**
- Their body clock is slowly shifting
- Sleep pressure at 5 AM is genuinely low
- Consistency is the only fix

**What victory looks like for you:**
- Sleeping until 6 AM or later
- Not treating 5 AM as morning
- Waking to light, not darkness

Early mornings are frustrating. But every step later is progress. Keep treating them as night wakings.
