## Wins for the Nap Disaster

If naps were your biggest struggle, here's what progress looks like:

**Celebrate if:**
- ONE nap lasted longer than 30 minutes
- Baby fell asleep independently for a nap (even if it was short)
- You successfully did "crib hour" without rescuing
- Any nap happened in the crib instead of on you

**Why these matter:**
- Nap training is harder than night training - fact
- Independent falling asleep is the first goal
- Length comes second (and takes longer)

**Realistic expectations:**
- Night sleep typically improves first
- Naps can take 2-3 weeks to consolidate
- Short naps with independent sleep onset are still progress

**The goal order:**
1. Fall asleep independently for naps (Week 1)
2. Nap consistently in crib (Week 1-2)
3. Naps lengthen (Week 2-4)

**What victory looks like for you:**
- At least one nap over an hour
- Both naps in the crib
- Not dreading nap time

Naps are the marathon, not the sprint. If they're falling asleep on their own, you're winning.
