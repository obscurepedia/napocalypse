## Wins for the Frequent Waker

You were waking every 1-2 hours. Here's what progress looks like for YOU:

**Celebrate if you had:**
- ONE stretch of 3+ hours (that's double what you were getting!)
- Any wake-up where baby settled faster than before
- A night where you counted fewer wake-ups than usual
- One where you didn't have to do the full intervention

**What these wins mean:**
- Your baby's body is learning a new pattern
- The frequent waking habit is being rewritten
- Each longer stretch proves it's possible

**What to look for this week:**
- Early-night stretches lengthen first
- Then middle-of-night improves
- Early morning is usually last

**Perspective shift:**
- Going from 6 wake-ups to 4 is a 33% improvement
- Going from 2-hour stretches to 3-hour stretches is HUGE
- You're moving in the right direction

**What victory looks like for you:**
- Sleeping in 4+ hour stretches
- 1-2 wake-ups max
- Actually getting REM cycles

You're not there yet, but you're closer than you were. Keep going.
