## You Did This While Working

Let me paint the picture of what you just pulled off:

You did sleep training while holding down a job.

You were exhausted at work, barely functioning in meetings, running on coffee and adrenaline - and you still showed up for bedtime every night. You still followed through on the method. You still pushed through when every cell in your body wanted to give up.

**What you accomplished:**
- Sleep trained while sleep deprived
- Maintained work responsibilities
- Stayed consistent despite exhaustion
- Prioritized long-term gain over short-term ease

**The payoff:**
- Better sleep for everyone
- Actually functional at work
- Energy left for your family
- Evenings back

**What this proves:**
- You can handle hard things with competing demands
- You can prioritize what matters
- You're resourceful and resilient

You didn't just teach your baby to sleep. You did it while juggling everything else. That's exceptional.
