## From 4 AM Wake-Ups to Actual Mornings

Remember what it was like starting your day in the dark?

Fourteen days ago, your day was starting at 4 or 5 AM. You were watching the sun rise not because you wanted to, but because your baby decided 4:30 was morning. Every day felt longer than it should.

And now you're sleeping until an actual reasonable hour.

**What you overcame:**
- The hardest sleep issue to fix
- Patience required (early mornings take the longest)
- The temptation to just start the day
- Treating 5 AM like any other wake

**What you achieved:**
- Sleeping until 6 AM or later
- A morning that feels like morning
- Energy for the actual day
- No more predawn misery

**Why this was hard:**
Early morning wakes are driven by low sleep pressure. Your baby's body genuinely wants to be awake. Pushing through that takes real commitment.

You stuck with it when improvement came slowly. That patience paid off.

Welcome back to actual mornings.
