## From Every 1-2 Hours to Sleeping Through

Let me remind you where you started:

Fourteen days ago, you were waking every 1-2 hours. That's not tired - that's survival mode. That's barely-functioning, questioning-everything, wondering-if-you'd-ever-sleep-again exhaustion.

And now look at you.

**What you overcame:**
- Chronic sleep deprivation
- A baby conditioned to wake constantly
- Feeding/soothing habits that reinforced the waking
- Doubt that things could ever change

**What you achieved:**
- Long stretches of sleep (for both of you)
- A baby who can sleep independently
- Your own sleep cycles restored
- Actual rest

**The magnitude of this:**
Going from 6+ wake-ups to sleeping through isn't incremental improvement. It's a complete transformation. You rewrote your baby's entire sleep pattern.

You're not just a little less tired. You're a different version of yourself - one who can think clearly, be present, and actually function.

That's huge. You did that.
