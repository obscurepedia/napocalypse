## From Nap Disaster to Nap Success

Remember when naps made you want to cry?

Fourteen days ago, naps were your nemesis. 30-minute cat naps. Fighting every single one. Never knowing if you'd get a break. Dreading each nap attempt.

And now naps are actually working.

**What you overcame:**
- The hardest part of sleep training (naps really are harder)
- The patience naps require (they take longer than night sleep)
- The temptation to rescue short naps
- Crib hour when every instinct said to go in

**What you achieved:**
- Naps in the crib
- Independent falling asleep
- Longer (or at least longer-ish) naps
- Not dreading nap time

**Why this matters:**
Good naps = less overtired baby = better night sleep. Naps affect everything.

**The truth:**
Most parents crack night sleep faster than naps. You stuck with the harder piece. That took real commitment.

You conquered naps. That's no small thing.
