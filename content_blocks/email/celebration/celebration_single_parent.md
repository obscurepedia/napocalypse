## You Did This Alone

I need you to really hear this:

You did this alone.

Every wake-up. Every check-in. Every 3 AM moment of doubt. No partner to tag team with. No one to reassure you at your lowest moment. Just you.

And you did it anyway.

**What you accomplished:**
- Made every decision solo
- Followed through without backup
- Pushed through when you wanted to quit
- Prioritized your family's sleep health

**What this proves:**
- You can handle hard things
- You can trust your own judgment
- You don't need someone else to validate your choices

**For the future:**
- You know you can do hard parenting solo
- You have the skills to handle whatever comes next
- Regressions, transitions, challenges - you've proven you can manage

You should be incredibly proud. Not just for the sleep success, but for showing yourself what you're capable of.

You did this alone. And you crushed it.
