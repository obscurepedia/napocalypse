## Adjusting Your Routine: Rocking to Sleep

Since your baby currently needs rocking to fall asleep, your routine needs to include calming activities that AREN'T motion-based.

**The key change: Replace rocking with stationary soothing**

Your new routine might look like:
1. Feed (if part of bedtime)
2. Bath or wipe-down
3. PJs in dim light
4. Book or song while you HOLD them (sitting, not rocking)
5. Brief cuddle, then into crib AWAKE

**Why this works:**
- They still get physical comfort and closeness
- The motion stops before they're asleep
- They learn to do the last part (falling asleep) on their own

**The hardest part:**
- That moment when you put them down awake
- They're used to being rocked until fully asleep
- Expect protest - this is the skill they're learning

**Pro tip:** If you've been rocking for 30+ minutes, that's exhausting for YOU too. The short-term protest is worth long-term sanity.

You're not taking away comfort. You're teaching them they don't need motion to sleep.
