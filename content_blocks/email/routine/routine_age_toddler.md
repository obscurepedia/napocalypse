## Bedtime Routines for 13+ Month Olds

Toddlers can handle (and often need) a slightly longer routine with more engagement. They also benefit from clear expectations and choices.

**Ideal routine length:** 20-30 minutes

**Toddler routine example:**
1. Announce "bedtime in 5 minutes" (transition warning)
2. Bath or wash-up
3. Brush teeth
4. PJs and fresh diaper
5. 2-3 short books (let them choose from 3 options)
6. Songs or quiet talk about the day
7. Consistent goodnight ritual + into crib/bed

**Toddler-specific tips:**
- Give limited choices: "Blue PJs or green PJs?"
- Use visual cues: a bedtime chart they can follow
- Set boundaries: "We read two books. You can pick which two."
- Keep the final goodbye SHORT - don't get roped into "one more"

**What toddlers will try:**
- Stalling tactics (water, potty, another book)
- Testing boundaries
- Big emotions about separation

Stay calm, be consistent, don't engage with stalling. The routine ends when you say it ends.
