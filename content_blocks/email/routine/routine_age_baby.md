## Bedtime Routines for 4-12 Month Olds

At this age, your routine should be simple and calm. Babies don't need elaborate wind-downs - they need predictability.

**Ideal routine length:** 15-20 minutes

**Classic routine example:**
1. Bath or warm wipe-down
2. Fresh diaper and PJs
3. Feed (if part of routine - keep them awake!)
4. One short, quiet book
5. Brief cuddle + consistent sleep phrase
6. Into crib awake

**Key principles:**
- Same order, same activities, every night
- Dim lights for the whole routine
- Keep it boring - no stimulating toys or games
- End with them awake in the crib

**What to avoid:**
- Screens within 1 hour of bedtime
- Exciting play or roughhousing
- Feeding until fully asleep
- Varying the routine based on their mood

The routine is the signal. Keep it consistent and they'll start anticipating sleep.
