## Adjusting Your Routine: Pacifier Dependency

If your baby needs a pacifier to fall asleep, you have a choice to make during the routine: keep it or drop it.

**Option A: Keep the pacifier (for now)**
- Offer it at the END of the routine, just before crib
- Don't replace it if it falls out after they're asleep
- Scatter multiple pacifiers in the crib (if 7+ months)
- Address full pacifier weaning later (Day 10)

**Option B: Drop it now**
- Remove all pacifiers tonight
- Use your sleep training method to handle the protest
- Cold turkey is faster but harder in the short term

**If you keep it for now:**
- The goal: they fall asleep with it, but don't need you to replace it
- Put them down drowsy but awake, pacifier in
- Don't rush in when it falls out - see if they settle without it

**Making the decision:**
- If pacifier reinsertion is your main problem: consider dropping it now
- If you have bigger battles (feeding, rocking): tackle those first

Either way, we'll address the pacifier fully on Day 10.
