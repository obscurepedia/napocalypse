## Adjusting Your Routine: Feeding to Sleep

Since your baby currently feeds to sleep, we need to strategically reorder your routine to break that association.

**The key change: Feed FIRST, not last**

Instead of: Bath > PJs > Feed (asleep)
Try: Feed > Bath > PJs > Book > Bed (awake)

**Why this works:**
- Creates a buffer between eating and sleeping
- The bath "resets" their alertness after the feed
- They learn that full belly doesn't mean immediate sleep

**Tips for the transition:**
- Keep them awake during the feed (lights brighter, talk to them)
- If they get drowsy, do a diaper change to wake them
- The goal: put them in the crib with full tummy but open eyes

**Expect some protest:**
- They'll be confused the first few nights
- This is different from what they know
- Stay consistent - they'll adapt within 3-5 nights

You're not taking away the comfort of feeding. You're teaching them that sleep is a separate skill.
