## The Working Parent's 15-Minute Routine

You get home at 6, bedtime is 7 - you don't have an hour for an elaborate wind-down. Good news: you don't need one.

**The Express Routine (15 minutes):**

1. **Quick wipe-down or short bath** (5 mins) - Skip if needed
2. **PJs + diaper in dim room** (3 mins)
3. **One short book or song** (3 mins)
4. **Brief cuddle + consistent phrase** (2 mins)
5. **Into crib awake** (2 mins)

**Why this works:**
- Consistency matters more than duration
- The same 3-5 steps every night = predictable signal
- Your baby will start recognizing "this means sleep"

**Quality over quantity:**
- Be fully present for those 15 minutes (phone away)
- Same order every single night
- Don't rush through it - calm energy matters

**If you have even less time:**
- Minimum routine: diaper, PJs, one song, into crib
- Still works as long as it's consistent

You don't need Pinterest bedtime perfection. You need reliability.
