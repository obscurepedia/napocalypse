## Your Challenge: Breaking the Motion/Rocking Dependency

You identified motion (rocking, bouncing, stroller, car) as your primary challenge. Your baby has learned that sleep = movement, and now they can't sleep without it.

**Why it matters:**
Motion is a powerful sleep tool for newborns, but older babies need to learn still sleep. When they wake between sleep cycles (every 90-120 min), they need the same conditions to fall back asleep: you rocking them.

**The fix: Transition from motion to still sleep.**

**Your strategy (starting tonight):**

1. **Reduce motion gradually during bedtime routine**
   - Start with gentle rocking (2-3 minutes)
   - Slow it down to stillness
   - Put baby down before fully asleep
   
2. **Use stationary support first**
   - Hand on chest while in crib (1-2 min)
   - Gentle patting (rhythmic but not rocking)
   - Then remove your hand
   
3. **Apply your chosen method**
   - Use CIO or Gentle check-ins from here
   - Resist the urge to pick up and rock

**For naps:**
- Use the same approach
- If baby won't nap in crib yet, one "rescue nap" in motion is okay (to avoid overtired spiral)
- Prioritize crib naps for first nap of day

**What to expect:**
- First 3 nights: protest (they're expecting rocking)
- By night 5-7: accepting still sleep
- Within 2 weeks: independent sleep, no motion

**Remember:** You're not being mean—you're teaching them to sleep anywhere, anytime. That's freedom for both of you!
