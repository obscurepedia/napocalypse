## Your Challenge: Breaking Pacifier Dependency

You identified pacifier dependency as your primary challenge. Your baby falls asleep with the pacifier, but wakes up crying every time it falls out—sometimes 6-10 times per night.

**Why it matters:**
The pacifier becomes a sleep association. Every time your baby stirs between sleep cycles (normal!), they need the pacifier reinserted to fall back asleep. You're essentially their human pacifier re-inserter all night long.

**The fix: Remove or teach independence.**

**Your strategy (pick one):**

**Option 1: Cold Turkey Removal** (fastest, 3-5 nights)
- Tonight, no pacifier at all
- Use your chosen method (CIO or Gentle) for bedtime
- Expect protest (they're confused), but stay consistent
- By night 5, baby learns new self-soothing

**Option 2: Gradual Weaning** (gentler, 7-10 days)
- **Days 1-3:** Give pacifier at bedtime, but don't reinsert overnight
- **Days 4-7:** Remove pacifier once baby is drowsy (before fully asleep)
- **Days 8+:** No pacifier at bedtime

**For bedtime routine:**
- Offer pacifier during calm activities (books, cuddles)
- Remove it before putting baby in crib
- Say "Pacifier stays in my pocket, sleep time now"

**What to expect:**
- **Cold turkey:** 30-60 min crying nights 1-2, improvement by night 3
- **Gradual:** Incremental progress, less intense protest
- Both methods work—choose what feels right

**Pro tip:** Scatter 3-4 pacifiers in crib corners. Older babies (8+ months) can learn to find and reinsert themselves.

You're teaching a lifelong skill: self-soothing without a prop!
