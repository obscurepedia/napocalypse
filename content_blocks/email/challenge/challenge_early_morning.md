## Your Challenge: Early Morning Wakings (4-6 AM)

You identified early morning wakings as your primary challenge. Your baby wakes up at 5 AM (or earlier) ready to party, and you're exhausted.

**Why it matters:**
True wake-up time should be 6-7 AM. Early wakings rob your baby of restorative sleep and leave you running on fumes. This is fixable!

**Common causes:**
- ❌ Bedtime too late (overtired → fragmented sleep)
- ❌ Bedtime too early (not enough sleep pressure by morning)
- ❌ Room too bright (sunrise wakes baby)
- ❌ Hunger (if baby is still needing early feed)
- ❌ Treating 5 AM like wake-up (reinforcing the habit)

**The fix: Environmental + behavioral changes.**

**Your strategy (starting tonight):**

1. **Optimize bedtime**
   - Goal: 7-8 PM (not later!)
   - Counterintuitive: Earlier bedtime often = later wake-up
   
2. **Blackout everything**
   - Pitch-black room (tape over any light sources)
   - Blackout curtains that block ALL sunrise light
   
3. **Treat early waking like a night waking**
   - If baby wakes before 6 AM, use your chosen method
   - CIO: Don't go in until 6 AM
   - Gentle: Check-ins at intervals, but don't start the day
   - **Don't turn on lights, don't get baby up**
   
4. **Set a "wake-up time" (6-7 AM)**
   - Use a toddler clock or consistent routine cue
   - Only get baby when clock shows wake-up time

**What to expect:**
- Week 1: Baby still waking early, but you're staying consistent
- Week 2-3: Wake-up time gradually shifting later
- By week 4: Sleeping until 6-7 AM consistently

**Be patient:** This takes longer than other sleep fixes (2-4 weeks). Stay strong!
