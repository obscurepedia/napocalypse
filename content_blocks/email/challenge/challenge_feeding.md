## Your Challenge: Breaking the Feed-to-Sleep Association

You identified feeding-to-sleep as your primary challenge. This is one of the most common sleep associations—and one of the most fixable.

**Why it matters:**
When your baby always falls asleep while feeding, they don't learn to fall asleep any other way. Every time they wake between sleep cycles (normal!), they need the same conditions to fall back asleep: your breast or bottle.

**The fix: Separate feeding from sleeping.**

**Your strategy (starting tonight):**

1. **Move feeding earlier in the routine**
   - Feed **20-30 minutes before** putting baby down
   - Example: Feed at 6:30 PM, bedtime at 7 PM
   
2. **Keep baby awake during feed**
   - Lights brighter, talk softly, tickle feet if needed
   - Goal: Full feed while alert
   
3. **Add buffer activities**
   - After feeding: diaper change, book, song
   - 5-10 minutes between feed and crib
   
4. **Put down awake**
   - Baby should go into crib with open eyes
   - Use your chosen method (CIO or Gentle) from here

**What to expect:**
- First few nights: protest (they're confused by the change)
- By night 5-7: accepting new routine
- Within 2 weeks: independent sleep without feeding

**Night feeds:** If baby is under 6 months and still needs a feed, keep it brief, lights off, no talking. Make it boring.

You're not taking away comfort—you're teaching a new skill!
