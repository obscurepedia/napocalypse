## Your Challenge: Conquering Short Naps

You identified short naps (30-45 minutes) as your primary challenge. Your baby falls asleep fine but wakes up after one sleep cycle and can't go back to sleep.

**Why it matters:**
Short naps = cranky baby, unpredictable schedule, and exhausted parents. Babies need restorative naps (60-90+ minutes) to consolidate learning and avoid overtired meltdowns.

**The root cause:**
At the end of each sleep cycle (30-50 min), your baby partially wakes. If they can't self-soothe, the nap ends. This is why you get exactly 30-minute naps on repeat.

**The fix: Teach cycle linking.**

**Your strategy (starting today):**

1. **Nail the wake windows** (this is 80% of the battle)
   - Too short = not tired enough to push through cycles
   - Too long = overtired, can't settle
   - Use yesterday's wake windows religiously
   
2. **Use "Crib Hour" for first nap**
   - Put baby down using your method (CIO or Gentle)
   - If they wake before 60 minutes, **leave them in crib for 10-15 min**
   - Don't rush in—give them space to practice falling back asleep
   - If they don't resettle after 15 min, end the nap
   
3. **Stay consistent with method**
   - Same approach for naps as bedtime
   - Don't rescue with motion/feeding

**What to expect:**
- Days 1-5: Mostly short naps, but baby practicing
- Days 6-10: Some extended naps (60-90 min)
- Week 2-3: Consistent longer naps

**One "rescue nap" is okay:** If all naps are disasters, let one nap happen in motion to avoid overtired spiral.

Patience pays off—nap lengthening takes longer than night sleep!
