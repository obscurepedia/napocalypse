## Pacifiers: Quick Guidance

Today's topic is pacifiers - and since your baby's main sleep association isn't the pacifier, this might not be your primary battle.

But the concept still applies: **we're teaching your baby to self-soothe without external help**, whether that's a pacifier, a bottle, or rocking.

**If you DO use a pacifier:**
- Consider whether you're reinserting it multiple times a night
- If yes, it's becoming a crutch
- If no, carry on - it's not a problem

**The principle:**
Whatever your baby needs to fall asleep, they'll need it every time they wake. That's true for pacifiers, nursing, rocking - all of it.

Read through today's content anyway. The strategies apply to breaking any sleep dependency.

Tomorrow we'll talk about feeding to sleep, which may be more relevant to your situation.
