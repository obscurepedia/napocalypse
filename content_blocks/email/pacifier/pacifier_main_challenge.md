## The Pacifier Problem: This Is Your Day

Today is YOUR day. You told me pacifier reinserting is driving you crazy, and I hear you.

Playing binky-pong 8 times a night is exhausting and unsustainable. You're basically a human pacifier-replacement machine. Let's fix it.

**Why it's happening:**
- Your baby associates pacifier = sleep
- When they wake between sleep cycles, they need it to fall back asleep
- They haven't learned to sleep without it

**The impact:**
- Multiple wake-ups just to plug it back in
- You're barely sleeping because you're on paci-duty
- Your baby isn't learning to self-soothe

**Your options (detailed above):**
1. Teach self-replacement (for 7+ months)
2. Go cold turkey

**My recommendation:**
- If your baby has fine motor skills: try self-replacement first
- If they're younger or you want it DONE: cold turkey

**What to expect:**
- Cold turkey: 2-3 hard nights, then done
- Self-replacement: 1-2 weeks of practice

The pacifier doesn't have to run your nights. Pick your approach and commit.
