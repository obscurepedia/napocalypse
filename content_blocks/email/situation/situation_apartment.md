## Your Situation: Apartment Living (Thin Walls)

You live in an apartment with close neighbors, and you're worried about crying disturbing others. This is a valid concern—but it shouldn't stop you from sleep training.

**The reality check:**
- Most sleep training crying happens at bedtime (7-8 PM, when neighbors are awake)
- The worst crying is nights 1-3 (then it drops dramatically)
- Total crying time is usually less than you think (30-60 min max)
- Your neighbors probably hear less than you imagine

**Your strategy:**

**1. Communicate proactively**
- Leave a note for immediate neighbors: "We're sleep training our baby this week. There may be some crying for a few nights, but it will be temporary. We apologize for any disruption and appreciate your patience!"
- Most neighbors are understanding (especially parents themselves)

**2. Strategic timing**
- Start on a Friday or Saturday night (neighbors more tolerant on weekends)
- Avoid starting during neighbors' big events/holidays

**3. Sound dampening**
- White noise in baby's room (masks some crying, helps baby too)
- Close windows during bedtime hour
- Put a rolled towel under the door (reduces sound leakage)
- Hang heavy curtains or tapestries on shared walls (absorbs sound)

**4. Use your method confidently**
- Gentle method (check-ins) = intermittent crying
- CIO method = continuous but often shorter total duration
- Both work—choose what feels right, not what seems "quieter"

**The truth:**
You deserve sleep. Your baby deserves to learn independent sleep. 3-5 nights of temporary noise is worth a lifetime of healthy sleep. Be polite, be prepared, but don't let fear of judgment stop you.

You're a great parent—advocate for your family's needs!
