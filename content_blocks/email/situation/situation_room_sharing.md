## Your Situation: Room Sharing with Baby

You're room sharing with your baby, which is both safe and recommended—but it can make sleep training trickier. The good news: you absolutely can sleep train while room sharing.

**The challenges:**
- You hear every sound (and rush in too quickly)
- Baby hears/sees you (harder to settle independently)
- Your movements wake baby
- Baby's noises wake you

**The solutions:**

**1. Create separate sleep zones**
- Use a room divider, curtain, or screen between your bed and crib
- Position crib as far from your bed as possible
- Consider a white noise machine placed between you

**2. Manage your response time**
- **Wait 5-10 minutes** before responding to noises
- Learn the difference between sleep sounds (grunts, sighs) and real waking
- Use earplugs during partner's "on duty" hours if needed

**3. Minimize your sleep disruptions**
- Use a dim red night light (not white/blue)
- Keep a water bottle bedside to avoid kitchen trips
- If you must move around, move slowly and quietly

**4. Consider a temporary separation (optional)**
- During the first 3-5 nights of sleep training, one parent could sleep elsewhere
- Reduces mutual wake-ups during the learning phase
- Return to room sharing once baby is sleeping better

**The reality:**
Room sharing works! You don't need to move baby out to sleep train successfully. With some strategic adjustments and patience, your whole family can sleep better—in the same room.

You've got this!
