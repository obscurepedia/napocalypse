## The 8-10 Month Sleep Regression

This is the separation anxiety regression - and it's emotional for everyone.

**What's happening:**
- Object permanence is developing (they know you exist when you leave)
- Separation anxiety peaks
- They may be learning to crawl, stand, or cruise

**What it looks like:**
- Crying when you leave the room (not just at sleep time)
- More frequent night waking
- Standing in crib and "stuck" there
- Clingier during the day

**What to do:**
- Extra cuddles and connection during wake time
- Same response at night - don't change your method
- If they stand in crib: lay down once, then leave
- They haven't forgotten how to sleep - they're just anxious

**Key strategies:**
- Practice leaving and returning during the day (peekaboo, hide and seek)
- Keep bedtime routine loving and connected
- Quick goodbyes are better than prolonged ones

**Timeline:**
- Usually 2-4 weeks, sometimes up to 6
- Consistency speeds it up

This is developmental, not a sleep skill problem. Ride it out with your usual approach.
