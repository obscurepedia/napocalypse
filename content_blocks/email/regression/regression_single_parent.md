## Handling Regressions Solo

A regression when you're parenting alone feels like a gut punch. You thought you were done with this.

**What you're feeling:**
- "Did I do something wrong?"
- "Am I back to square one?"
- "I can't do another week of this alone"

**Here's the truth:**
- You didn't do anything wrong
- You're not back to square one
- Regressions are temporary - usually 3-7 days

**Survival strategies:**
- Lower your expectations for a few days (let some things slide)
- Lean on daytime support if you have it
- Remind yourself: you've done this before

**Your advantage:**
- You know your baby's patterns
- You know the method works
- This time will be faster because the foundation is there

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't revert to old habits (feeding to sleep, cosleeping out of desperation)
- Don't change methods mid-regression
- Don't panic

You've already proven you can do hard things alone. This is just a temporary setback, not a restart.
