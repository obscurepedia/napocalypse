## The 12 and 18-Month Sleep Regressions

Toddlers get hit twice - and both regressions are about independence and boundaries.

**The 12-month regression:**
- Walking and language explosion
- Drop from 2 naps to 1 (sometimes)
- Testing limits at bedtime

**The 18-month regression:**
- Language and communication leap
- Major boundary testing
- May seem sudden and intense

**What it looks like:**
- Bedtime battles increase
- Night wakings return
- Naps become a fight
- More verbal resistance

**What to do:**
- Same method, same approach - no changes
- They're testing if the rules still apply
- Don't create new habits out of desperation

**Toddler-specific strategies:**
- More physical activity during the day
- Clear, consistent bedtime boundaries
- Don't negotiate (they'll try)
- Keep goodbyes SHORT

**Timeline:**
- Usually 2-4 weeks
- Can feel longer because toddlers are persistent

They haven't forgotten how to sleep. They're just checking if you've forgotten the rules. Show them you haven't.
