## The 4-Month Sleep Regression

If your baby is in this age range, you're in (or approaching) the famous 4-month regression.

**What's happening:**
- Sleep cycles are maturing to adult patterns
- They're now waking fully between cycles (instead of sleeping through)
- This is permanent brain development, not a phase

**What it looks like:**
- Previously good sleeper suddenly waking frequently
- Short naps that don't lengthen
- Harder to settle at bedtime

**The silver lining:**
- This is actually WHY sleep training works at this age
- Now that they have mature sleep cycles, they can learn to connect them
- Sleep training now = addressing this directly

**What to do:**
- Stay consistent with your method
- This isn't backsliding - it's their brain developing
- The skills you're teaching address this exact issue

**Timeline:**
- The "regression" part lasts 2-4 weeks
- Sleep training during this time is ideal
- You're teaching them to handle their new sleep architecture

You're not starting over. You're solving the problem.
