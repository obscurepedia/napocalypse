## Regressions in an Apartment: Round Two

A regression means more crying - and you're back to worrying about neighbors.

**Here's the reassurance:**
- It's temporary (3-7 days usually)
- Your neighbors survived round one
- Regressions are typically shorter than initial training

**What to tell yourself:**
- "We've been through this before"
- "This is a blip, not a restart"
- "A few nights won't get me evicted"

**Practical steps:**
- White noise back to full volume
- Quick neighbor heads-up if you're worried: "Sleep regression this week"
- Remember: most neighbors are far more tolerant than we imagine

**If apartment guilt makes you want to give in:**
- Giving in extends the regression
- Staying consistent shortens it
- The crying now prevents weeks of crying later

**Perspective:**
- Your baby needs you to stay the course
- The rules haven't changed - you're just reminding them
- This time will be faster

Your neighbors will survive. Trust the process.
