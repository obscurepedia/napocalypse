## Optimizing the Nursery

You have a dedicated sleep space - that's a huge advantage. Now let's make it work for you.

**The darkness test:**
- Go in during the middle of the day
- Close the door and cover windows completely
- Can you see your hand? If yes, add more coverage.
- Use blackout curtains, cardboard, or aluminum foil - whatever works

**White noise placement:**
- Between the door and the crib (blocks hallway noise)
- Not too close to their head
- Volume: about as loud as a shower

**Temperature check:**
- Ideal: 68-72 degrees
- Cooler is better than warmer
- Dress baby appropriately (one more layer than you'd wear)

**Remove distractions:**
- No mobiles or light-up toys they can activate
- Keep the crib boring - it's for sleep, not play

A well-optimized nursery does half the work for you.
