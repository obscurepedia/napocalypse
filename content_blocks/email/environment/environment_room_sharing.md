## Sleep Training While Room Sharing

Room sharing makes this trickier - but it's absolutely doable. The key is creating separation within the shared space.

**Creating a "sleep zone":**
- Use a room divider or curtain to visually separate the crib area
- This prevents your baby from seeing you when they wake
- Even a tension rod with a blackout curtain works

**Managing your presence:**
- Your breathing, movement, and phone light can all wake baby
- Consider sleeping elsewhere for the first 3-5 nights of training
- If that's not possible, be as still and quiet as possible after bedtime

**The white noise trick:**
- Place it between you and the crib
- It masks your sounds from baby AND baby's sounds from you
- Helps you both sleep better

**Long-term consideration:**
- If room sharing is temporary, prioritize moving baby out once sleep is established
- If it's permanent, the visual barrier becomes essential

Room sharing works. It just requires more intentional boundaries.
