## Optimizing Sleep in an Apartment

Living in an apartment adds a layer of complexity - you're probably worried about noise traveling to neighbors, and outside noise waking your baby.

**For darkness:**
- Blackout curtains are your best friend (block streetlights and neighbor lights)
- Cover any LED lights from smoke detectors or electronics

**For sound:**
- White noise is essential - it masks hallway noise, street sounds, and neighbor activity
- Place the machine between the noise source and the crib
- Run it all night, not just at sleep onset

**About the neighbors:**
- Most apartment walls muffle crying more than you think
- White noise helps on their side too
- If you're worried, a quick heads-up ("we're sleep training this week") buys goodwill
- Remember: a few nights of crying beats months of everyone being exhausted

Your baby can absolutely learn to sleep well in an apartment. The environment adjustments just need to be a bit more intentional.
