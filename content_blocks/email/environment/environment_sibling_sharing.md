## Sleep Training with a Sibling in the Room

Two kids, one room - this is advanced level, but it works.

**The timing strategy:**
- Stagger bedtimes: older child goes down 30-45 minutes earlier
- Once baby is sleep trained, you can align bedtimes
- Consider temporarily separating them (baby in your room, sibling in theirs)

**Protecting the older child:**
- Explain what's happening: "Baby is learning to sleep. There might be some crying."
- White noise helps mask sounds for both
- Most older kids sleep through it within a night or two

**If separation isn't possible:**
- Do the first 2-3 nights on a weekend so everyone can recover
- Your older child is more resilient than you think
- Once baby is trained, everyone benefits

**The long game:**
- Shared rooms actually work well once both kids are sleep trained
- Kids sync their sleep patterns over time
- It's the training period that's tricky, not the long-term

A few rough nights are worth years of easy bedtimes.
