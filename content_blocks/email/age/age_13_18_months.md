## Your Toddler at 13-18 Months: The One-Nap Transition

Welcome to toddlerhood! Your little one is probably walking, talking (or trying!), and asserting their independence. Sleep can become a battleground if you let it—but it doesn't have to be.

**What's happening now:**
- Transitioning from 2 naps → 1 nap (usually around 15-18 months)
- Strong opinions about bedtime ("No!")
- Increased imagination (fears, dreams)
- Can stay awake 5-6 hours comfortably

**Your toddler's wake windows:**
- **Morning to nap:** 5-6 hours
- **Nap to bedtime:** 4-5 hours
- **Nap length:** 1.5-3 hours (one solid afternoon nap)

**Quick tip:** The 2→1 nap transition is tricky. You'll see signs like fighting the morning nap, shorter afternoon nap, or bedtime battles. When this happens, push the morning nap later by 15 minutes every few days until it becomes an afternoon nap (around 12-1 PM).

**Your focus today:** Hold firm on boundaries. Toddlers test limits—that's their job. Your job is to stay consistent. Same bedtime routine, same response to protests. They're looking for the edges; you provide them.

You're teaching life skills, not just sleep skills!
