## Your Baby at 7-12 Months: Building Momentum

Your baby is a confident little explorer! Developmentally, they're learning so much during the day—and that means they need restorative sleep at night to consolidate all that learning.

**What's happening now:**
- Strong sleep pressure (tired enough to sleep through)
- Crawling, standing, or cruising (burning lots of energy!)
- May resist sleep due to FOMO (fear of missing out)
- Can easily sleep 10-12 hours straight

**Your baby's wake windows:**
- **7-9 months:** 2.25-3 hours
- **10-12 months:** 3-4 hours
- **Naps:** Usually 2 naps (morning + afternoon)

**Quick tip:** Separation anxiety peaks around 8-10 months. Your baby's crying at bedtime might be about connection, not sleep skills. A consistent goodbye routine ("kiss, hug, I love you, goodnight") helps immensely.

**Your focus today:** Lean into the routine. Predictability = security. Same wake time, same nap times (within 30 minutes), same bedtime. Your baby will start to anticipate sleep and settle faster.

You're past the newborn chaos—now you're in the "lock it in" phase!
