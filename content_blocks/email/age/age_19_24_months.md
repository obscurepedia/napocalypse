## Your Toddler at 19-24 Months: The Master Negotiator

Your toddler is a full personality now—opinions, negotiations, and big feelings about *everything*, including sleep. This age brings unique challenges, but also amazing opportunities for independence.

**What's happening now:**
- One solid afternoon nap (1.5-3 hours)
- Bedtime resistance ("One more book!")
- Possible nightmares or night fears
- Can stay awake 5-6 hours easily

**Your toddler's schedule:**
- **Wake time:** 6:30-7:30 AM
- **Nap:** 12-3 PM (approximately)
- **Bedtime:** 7-8 PM
- **Total sleep:** 11-14 hours

**Quick tip:** Give choices within boundaries. "Do you want to brush teeth before or after pajamas?" (Not "Do you want to brush teeth?") This gives them control without derailing bedtime.

**Your focus today:** The bedtime routine is your anchor. Make it visual—use a picture chart showing the steps (bath, pajamas, teeth, books, bed). Toddlers love knowing what's next. When they protest, point to the chart: "Look, it's book time! Then it's sleep time."

**Limit-testing is normal.** Stay calm, stay consistent. You're the GPS, not the roadblock.

Your confident boundaries = their secure sleep!
