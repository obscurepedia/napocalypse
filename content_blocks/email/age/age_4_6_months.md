## Your Baby at 4-6 Months: The Golden Window

Your baby is in the sweet spot for sleep training! At this age, their circadian rhythm is established, and they're developmentally ready to learn self-soothing.

**What's happening now:**
- Sleep cycles have matured to 90-120 minutes
- Can sleep 6-8 hour stretches without feeding
- Distinguishes day from night
- Ready to practice independent sleep skills

**Your baby's wake windows:**
- **4 months:** 1.5-2 hours
- **5 months:** 2-2.25 hours  
- **6 months:** 2-2.5 hours

**Quick tip:** The 4-month "sleep regression" is actually sleep *progression*—your baby's sleep is maturing! This is the perfect time to establish healthy habits.

**Your focus today:** Time your baby's naps and bedtime using the wake windows above. If your 5-month-old wakes at 7 AM, aim for first nap around 9-9:15 AM. Watch for sleepy cues (yawning, eye rubbing) as you approach the end of the window.

Timing is everything—hit the window, and sleep becomes 10x easier!
