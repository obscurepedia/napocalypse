## Troubleshooting: Frequent Night Waking

You were waking every 1-2 hours before. Let's make sure that changes.

**If wake-ups haven't decreased yet:**
- Check your consistency: are you using the same response every time?
- Eliminate sneaky sleep crutches: any feeding, rocking, pacifier replacement?
- Review wake windows: overtired babies wake more

**Common patterns:**
- First half of night improves before second half
- One "stubborn" wake-up often remains longest
- Progress isn't linear - bad nights happen

**For the frequent waker specifically:**
- Your baby's body clock is conditioned to wake often
- It takes time to reset that pattern
- Each night of consistency rewrites the habit

**The timeline:**
- Nights 1-3: Expect similar or slightly better
- Nights 4-7: Should see noticeable decrease
- Week 2: Most frequent waking should resolve

**If no improvement after 7 nights:**
- Review: Are night feeds still happening? (Shift calories to day)
- Check environment: Is something waking them?
- Assess method: Are you being fully consistent?

Your baby CAN sleep longer stretches. The frequent waking is a habit that's being rewritten.
