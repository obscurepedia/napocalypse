## Apartment Night 2: The Neighbor Guilt

You made it through Night 1. Maybe you're worried about noise complaints. Maybe you're imagining angry texts.

**Reality check:**
- Most neighbors notice less than you think
- White noise muffles more than you realize
- One more night won't get you evicted

**If you're really anxious:**
- Check with neighbors today: "How was it?"
- Most will say "I didn't hear anything" or "Just a little"
- That reassurance helps

**If they DID hear it:**
- Apologize briefly, explain it's temporary
- Most people understand babies cry
- Offer an end timeline: "Should be better by end of week"

**Do NOT let apartment guilt derail you:**
- Stopping now means the Night 1 crying was for nothing
- You'll have to start over later
- A few nights of noise beats 12+ months of exhaustion

Your neighbors will survive. Your baby will learn to sleep. Stay the course.
