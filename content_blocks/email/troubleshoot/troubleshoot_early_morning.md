## Troubleshooting: Early Morning Wake-Ups

If your baby is still waking at 4 or 5 AM, you're not alone. Early mornings are the LAST thing to resolve.

**Why early mornings are hard:**
- Sleep pressure is lowest in the early morning
- Their body has already gotten "most" of its sleep
- Light and noise levels increase

**Common causes:**
- Bedtime too early (overtired at 6 PM = early wake)
- Bedtime too late (overtired = disrupted sleep)
- First morning light sneaking in
- Reinforcing the wake-up by starting the day

**The fix:**
- Treat any wake before 6 AM as a night waking (same method)
- Do NOT start the day before 6 AM (even if they're awake)
- Check room darkness - early morning sun matters
- Experiment with bedtime: try 15 mins later for a few nights

**What to expect:**
- Early mornings can take 2-3 weeks to resolve
- Other sleep improves first, then early mornings follow
- It's frustrating, but it WILL get better

Stay consistent with your method for pre-6 AM wakes. It works - it just takes longer.
