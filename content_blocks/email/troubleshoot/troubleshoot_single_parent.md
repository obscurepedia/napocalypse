## Staying Strong When You're Solo

Last night was hard. And you did it alone.

**Acknowledge what you're feeling:**
- Guilt (normal)
- Doubt (normal)
- Exhaustion (very normal)

**Here's what I need you to remember:**
- You don't need a partner to validate your choices
- Your baby is learning - this discomfort is temporary
- You're modeling resilience

**Survival tactics for tonight:**
- Prep everything before bedtime (you can't leave the room easily)
- Have a "mantra" ready: "This is hard and I can do it"
- Text a friend before bedtime so someone knows you're in the trenches
- Set a timer - knowing actual time helps

**The unfair truth:**
- You'll feel more doubt because there's no one to reassure you
- You'll question yourself more because there's no one to check with
- But you're also more consistent because there's only one approach

You're doing this for both of you. The nights WILL get easier.
