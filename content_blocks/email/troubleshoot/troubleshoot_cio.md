## Troubleshooting CIO: Common Issues

**"The crying went on forever"**
- Set a timer next time - perceived time is always longer
- Most crying peaks and then decreases
- If it truly went 1+ hour, check: was timing right? Room dark enough?

**"They were standing/sitting in the crib"**
- Lay them down ONCE, then leave
- Don't make it a game of you laying them down repeatedly
- They'll eventually lie down when tired enough

**"I gave in and picked them up"**
- Okay, it happened. Start fresh tomorrow
- Know that intermittent reinforcement makes things worse
- Commit to not picking up tomorrow (or adjust to a gentler method)

**"Night 2 was worse than Night 1"**
- This is extinction burst - totally normal
- It's actually a sign your baby is testing the new rules
- Night 3 is usually better. Hold the line.

**"They fell asleep but woke up an hour later"**
- Treat it like any other night waking - same approach
- Early-night wakings often extinguish first
- Focus on bedtime and early wakings will follow

The key with CIO is commitment. Half-measures don't work.
