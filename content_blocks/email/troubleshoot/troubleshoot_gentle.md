## Troubleshooting Gentle Methods: Common Issues

**"The crying got worse during my check-ins"**
- This is common - your presence reminds them you're there but not helping
- Keep checks brief (under 1 minute)
- Consider longer intervals between checks

**"It's been 7 days and not much has changed"**
- Gentle methods take longer - 10-14 days is normal
- Look for small improvements: less crying, faster settling
- Are you being fully consistent? Any sneaky sleep crutches?

**"I keep staying longer than I should during checks"**
- Set a timer for 30-60 seconds
- Script what you'll say: "I love you, it's time to sleep"
- Resist the urge to pick up - that undoes progress

**"I don't know if I should increase intervals or not"**
- If crying is decreasing: stay the course
- If crying is stable: try longer intervals
- If crying is increasing: make sure you're not overstimulating during checks

**"Should I switch to CIO?"**
- Only if you can commit fully to the new approach
- Switching methods mid-stream confuses baby
- Give gentle methods 2 full weeks before changing

Gentle takes patience. Trust the gradual improvement.
