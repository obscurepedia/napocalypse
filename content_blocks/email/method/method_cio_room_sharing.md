## CIO While Room Sharing: Making It Work

This is advanced mode, but it's absolutely doable.

**The challenge:** Your baby can see and smell you. That makes it harder for them to settle.

**The solution: Create visual separation**
- A room divider, curtain, or even a sheet creates a barrier
- Your baby can't see you = they stop looking for you
- Place it so they can't peek around it

**Strategic options:**
1. **Sleep elsewhere for 3-5 nights** - This is the fastest path. Use the couch, guest room, or even an air mattress in another room.
2. **Stay but be invisible** - If you must stay, get into bed before baby goes down, stay completely still and silent, keep phone on silent/dim.

**What to expect:**
- Baby may cry harder initially (they know you're close)
- Stay consistent - they'll learn the crib is for sleep
- Once trained, they'll ignore your presence at night

**After training is done:**
- The visual barrier is still helpful long-term
- Consider transitioning baby out if possible

It's harder, not impossible. Your consistency is what makes it work.
