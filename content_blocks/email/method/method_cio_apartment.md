## CIO in an Apartment: You Can Do This

I know what you're worried about: the neighbors.

Here's what I need you to hear: most apartment walls muffle sound more than you think. Your baby's crying probably sounds louder to YOU (because parent guilt amplifies everything) than it does to the person next door.

**Practical steps:**
- White noise on BOTH sides of the shared wall helps
- A quick heads-up to neighbors buys goodwill: "We're sleep training this week - sorry in advance for any noise"
- Most neighbors are understanding (they were babies once too)

**Perspective check:**
- A few nights of crying beats 12+ months of exhaustion
- Your baby learning to sleep benefits everyone
- The crying WILL decrease - often dramatically by night 3

**If anxiety is overwhelming:**
- Set a timer - knowing actual crying time vs. perceived helps
- Step outside your apartment door to hear what neighbors actually hear
- Remember: you're not being cruel, you're teaching a skill

You're allowed to prioritize your family's sleep health. A few nights of noise is not a reason to stay trapped in exhaustion.
