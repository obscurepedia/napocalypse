## Gentle Methods in an Apartment

Good news: gentle methods typically involve less intense crying, which can ease apartment anxiety.

**The reality check:**
- There will still be some crying or fussing
- It may last longer (gentle = more gradual)
- But the peaks are usually lower than CIO

**Apartment-specific tips:**
- White noise is still essential (masks sounds both ways)
- Your check-ins keep the volume lower
- If you're worried, heads-up to neighbors is still kind

**What to expect:**
- Protest crying during check-ins (you're there but not picking up)
- Fussing between checks
- Gradual improvement over 7-10 days

**The tradeoff:**
- Less intense = neighbors less likely to notice
- More gradual = process takes longer
- Your presence = baby may protest more vocally

You chose gentle for a reason. Trust your choice and stay consistent. The apartment situation doesn't change the approach - just remember that most walls muffle more than you think.
