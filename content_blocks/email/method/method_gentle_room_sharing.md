## Gentle Methods While Room Sharing

Your presence in the room is actually built into gentle methods - but you still need some separation.

**Why separation still matters:**
- Even with gentle methods, baby needs to learn to settle without you hovering
- Your visible presence can keep them more activated
- The goal is still independent sleep

**Making it work:**
1. **During training:** Sit in the room for checks, but not right next to crib
2. **Move gradually:** Start close, then move chair toward door over nights
3. **Visual barrier helps:** Even with gentle methods, not seeing you between checks helps

**Strategic approach:**
- Do your check-ins as planned
- Between checks, be as invisible as possible
- Consider the "out of sight" approach: step behind a divider between checks

**Your advantage:**
- You're already in the room for quick response
- Less distance to travel for check-ins
- They still learn to settle during the intervals

Room sharing + gentle methods = slower but absolutely workable. Trust the gradual process.
