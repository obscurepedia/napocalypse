## What to Expect Tonight: 4-12 Month Olds

Here's the truth about what might happen:

**Night 1:**
- Expect 20-45 minutes of crying at bedtime (could be more)
- Multiple night wakings with crying
- This is the hardest night - for YOU

**Night 2:**
- Often slightly better OR slightly worse (extinction burst)
- Your baby is testing: "Did the rules really change?"
- Stay consistent

**Night 3:**
- Most babies show significant improvement here
- Bedtime crying often drops to under 15 minutes
- Fewer night wakings

**By Night 5-7:**
- Bedtime should be under 10 minutes
- Night wakings should be minimal or gone
- You should be seeing real progress

**Your baby's age factors:**
- 4-6 months: May still need 1-2 night feeds (that's okay)
- 7-9 months: Separation anxiety may increase protest
- 10-12 months: May stand in crib (lay them down once, then leave)

**Important:** Progress isn't linear. A bad Night 4 doesn't erase progress. Trust the process.
