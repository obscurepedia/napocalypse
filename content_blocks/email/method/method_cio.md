## Your Method: Cry-It-Out (Full Extinction)

You've chosen the fastest, most effective approach. CIO means putting your baby down awake and not returning until morning. It sounds intense, but research shows it's safe and works quickly—most babies sleep through within 3-5 nights.

**Tonight's Plan:**

1. **Complete your bedtime routine** (bath, pajamas, book, song—20-30 minutes)
2. **Put baby in crib awake** (drowsy is okay, but eyes open)
3. **Say "Goodnight, I love you"** and leave the room
4. **Don't return until morning** (or after 10-12 hours)

**What to Expect:**
- **Night 1:** 30-90 minutes of crying (hard, but normal)
- **Night 2:** 20-60 minutes (may be worse—this is called "extinction burst," means it's working!)
- **Night 3:** 10-30 minutes (breakthrough!)
- **Nights 4-5:** 5-15 minutes or none at all

**Critical Rules:**
- ✅ Monitor on camera/audio—you'll know they're safe
- ✅ Only go in for emergencies (vomit, stuck limb, fever)
- ✅ If you need to feed (baby under 6 months), keep it brief and boring
- ❌ Don't peek, hover, or give in at 2 AM

**Why this works:** You're giving your baby uninterrupted time to practice self-soothing. Every time you go in, you reset the clock. Stay strong—the skill clicks fast.

You can do this. Tonight is Night 1. Trust the process.
