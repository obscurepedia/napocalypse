## Sleep Training Solo: Your Approach

You don't have a partner to tap out to at 3 AM. That's real, and I'm not going to pretend it isn't harder.

**What to know going in:**
- You need to be extra committed - there's no backup
- Self-care between nights is non-negotiable
- The payoff is huge: better sleep for BOTH of you

**Survival strategies:**
- Set everything up before bedtime (water, snacks, phone charged)
- Have a "tap-out" plan for your hardest moment (call a friend, step outside for 30 seconds)
- Use a timer - knowing actual crying time helps
- Remind yourself: this is temporary

**On your check-ins:**
- You're it - keep them brief and consistent
- Don't let guilt make you linger
- Trust your method

**After the first night:**
- Debrief with yourself: what worked, what was hardest?
- Adjust as needed (timing, your position)
- Celebrate that you did it

You're proving that you can handle hard things alone. Which, honestly, you already knew. This is just the latest example.
