## What to Expect Tonight: 13+ Month Olds

Toddlers are a different beast. They're smarter, more verbal, and much more persistent.

**Night 1:**
- Expect louder, longer protest (they have OPINIONS)
- Standing, bouncing, yelling, throwing things out of crib
- They may say words that break your heart ("Mama! Up!")
- This is the hardest night - emotionally

**Night 2:**
- Possible extinction burst (worse before better)
- They're testing: "If I scream louder, will it work?"
- Stay. Consistent.

**Night 3-5:**
- Most toddlers turn a corner here
- Still some protest, but intensity drops
- They're accepting the new rules

**By Week 2:**
- Bedtime should be calmer
- They'll test periodically (that's toddlerhood)
- Your consistency = their security

**Toddler-specific challenges:**
- Climbing out of crib (lower mattress, consider sleep sack)
- Verbal manipulation ("I love you! One more hug!")
- FOMO (they'd rather be with you)

**Your mantra:** "I can be more consistent than they are persistent."

They're not traumatized. They're just mad that the rules changed. They'll adjust.
