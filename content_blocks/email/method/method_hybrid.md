## Choosing Your Method: Let's Figure This Out Together

You said you weren't sure which approach felt right—that's completely normal. Here's the honest truth about both methods, so you can decide what works for your family.

**Option A: Cry-It-Out (CIO)**
- Put baby down awake, don't return until morning
- Fastest results: Most babies sleep through in 3-5 nights
- Hardest part: Night 1-2 can be 30-90 minutes of crying
- Best for: Parents who need quick results (returning to work, safety concerns from exhaustion)

**Option B: Gentle/Gradual (Check-and-Console)**
- Check on baby at increasing intervals (3 min, 5 min, 7 min...)
- Slower results: Takes 7-14 days typically
- Hardest part: Requires more patience and consistency over longer period
- Best for: Parents who need to be present, or those in apartments/room sharing

**How to Decide Right Now:**

Ask yourself: "Can I handle 2-3 really hard nights for faster results, or would I rather spread the difficulty over 1-2 weeks?"

- If you need results THIS WEEK → Go with CIO
- If you'd rather take it slower → Go with Gentle

**Here's the thing:** Both methods work. The "best" method is the one you'll actually stick with. If you start CIO and can't handle it, you'll go in at 2 AM and reset everything. If you start Gentle and get frustrated by slow progress, you'll give up.

**My recommendation for you:**

Since you're undecided, start with **Gentle/Gradual** tonight. It gives you a way to respond to crying while still teaching the skill. If after 4-5 nights you're not seeing progress, you can always switch to CIO with confidence.

**Tonight's Plan (Gentle Start):**

1. **Complete your bedtime routine** (20-30 minutes)
2. **Put baby in crib awake** and say "Goodnight, I love you"
3. **Leave the room**
4. **Wait 3 minutes** before first check-in
5. **Check-in (30 seconds max):** Pat chest, say "You're okay, it's sleep time," leave
6. **Wait 5 minutes,** then check again
7. **Continue 5-minute intervals** until baby falls asleep

**What to Expect Tonight:**
- 30-60 minutes of crying is normal
- You'll do 6-12 check-ins
- Baby will eventually fall asleep

After 3-4 nights, reply to this email and let me know how it's going. We can adjust from there.

You've got this. Tonight is Night 1.
