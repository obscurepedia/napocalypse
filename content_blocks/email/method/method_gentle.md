## Your Method: Gentle/Gradual (Check-and-Console)

You've chosen a balanced approach that builds your baby's confidence gradually. You'll check on them at increasing intervals, offering reassurance while giving them space to learn self-soothing.

**Tonight's Plan (Night 1):**

1. **Complete your bedtime routine** (bath, pajamas, book, song—20-30 minutes)
2. **Put baby in crib awake** (drowsy is okay, but eyes open)
3. **Say "Goodnight, I love you"** and leave the room
4. **Wait 3 minutes** before first check-in
5. **Check-in (30 seconds max):**
   - Enter calmly, pat chest or back
   - Say "It's sleep time, you're okay"
   - Leave immediately (don't pick up unless emergency)
6. **Wait 5 minutes,** then check again
7. **Continue 5-minute intervals** until baby falls asleep

**What to Expect:**
- **Nights 1-2:** 30-60 minutes of crying (normal!)
- **Nights 3-4:** 20-40 minutes (check-ins: 5 min → 7 min)
- **Nights 5-7:** 10-20 minutes (check-ins: 7 min → 10 min)
- **Week 2:** 5-10 minutes or none at all

**Critical Rules:**
- ✅ Keep check-ins brief and boring (no eye contact, no talking much)
- ✅ Increase intervals every 2 nights
- ✅ Stay consistent—same response every time
- ❌ Don't pick up unless necessary (reset progress)

**Why this works:** Your baby learns you're nearby but won't fix sleep for them. They build the skill gradually with your support.

Tonight is Night 1. You've got this!
