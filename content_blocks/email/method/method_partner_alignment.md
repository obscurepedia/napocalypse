## Getting Your Partner On Board

You're both exhausted. You're both doing your best. And you might not agree on this.

**Before tonight, have this conversation:**

1. **Why are we doing this?**
   - "We're both running on empty"
   - "Our baby needs to learn this skill"
   - "Short-term discomfort for long-term gain"

2. **What method are we using?**
   - Choose together, commit together
   - No switching mid-stream

3. **Who handles what?**
   - Divide bedtime vs. night wakings
   - Or alternate nights completely
   - Have a tap-out signal for tough moments

4. **What does consistency look like?**
   - Same response from both of you
   - No undermining each other's approach
   - United front for baby

**If your partner is hesitant:**
- Acknowledge their concerns (they're probably about crying)
- Agree on check-in frequency that feels okay to both
- Commit to re-evaluate after 3 nights

**The non-negotiable:**
Mixed signals = confused baby = longer process. Whatever you decide, decide it together.
