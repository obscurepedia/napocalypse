## Naps at 7-12 Months: Finding Your Rhythm

This is when naps start to consolidate and get more predictable.

**Typical nap schedule:**
- 2 naps per day (sometimes 3 for younger babies in this range)
- Wake windows: 2-3.5 hours
- Total daytime sleep: 2.5-3.5 hours

**Sample schedule (2 naps):**
- Wake: 7:00 AM
- Nap 1: 9:30 AM (2.5 hour window)
- Nap 2: 2:00 PM
- Bedtime: 7:00 PM (3.5 hour last wake window)

**The 3-to-2 nap transition (usually 7-8 months):**
- Signs: fighting the 3rd nap, longer wake windows, bedtime getting too late
- How to do it: drop the last nap, move bedtime earlier temporarily

**What to expect:**
- Naps should lengthen to 1-1.5 hours each
- If still getting cat naps, use "crib hour" (leave them for 60 mins total)
- First nap is usually the strongest

**Watch for:**
- Wake windows matter more now
- Under-tired = won't nap; over-tired = short naps
- Timing is everything
