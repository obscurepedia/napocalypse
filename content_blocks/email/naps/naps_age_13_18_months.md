## Naps at 13-18 Months: The Big Transition

This is the 2-to-1 nap transition - one of the trickiest in babyhood.

**Signs it's time:**
- Consistently fighting one of the naps
- Taking forever to fall asleep for nap 2
- Bedtime is getting too late
- They're closer to 14-15 months (rarely before 13 months)

**The transition approach:**
1. Move morning nap later by 15-30 mins every few days
2. Goal: one nap around 12:00-1:00 PM
3. Temporarily use early bedtime (6-6:30 PM) to bridge the gap
4. Expect 3-4 weeks of adjustment

**During the transition:**
- Alternate 1-nap and 2-nap days based on cues
- Early bedtime is your friend
- They may seem tired but that's normal

**After the transition:**
- One nap: 1.5-3 hours
- Wake windows: 5-6 hours
- Bedtime: 7-8 PM

**Typical schedule:**
- Wake: 7:00 AM
- Nap: 12:30 PM (1.5-2 hours)
- Bedtime: 7:30 PM

The transition is messy. Give it a full month before you judge it.
