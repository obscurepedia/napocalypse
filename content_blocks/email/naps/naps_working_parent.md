## Naps When You're Not Home

If you're working, naps happen on someone else's watch. That adds a variable.

**The key: Communication**

Make sure your daycare provider or nanny knows:
- Your baby's wake windows
- That baby goes down AWAKE
- No rocking, feeding, or holding to sleep
- The approach you're using at home

**The reality check:**
- Daycares often can't do perfect nap training conditions
- Multiple babies = less individualized attention
- That's okay - focus on what you CAN control

**What to prioritize:**
- Consistency at home (nights and weekends)
- Ask daycare to try putting baby down awake
- Accept that daycare naps may be shorter

**What you control:**
- Weekends: full nap training approach
- Nights: always consistent
- Communication: keep provider in the loop

**The truth:**
- Most babies adapt to "home rules" and "daycare rules"
- Night sleep usually improves even with imperfect daycare naps
- Don't stress what you can't control

Focus on your consistency at home. It's enough.
