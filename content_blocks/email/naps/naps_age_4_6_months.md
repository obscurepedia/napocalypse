## Naps at 4-6 Months: What to Expect

At this age, naps are still developing. Don't expect perfection yet.

**Typical nap schedule:**
- 3-4 naps per day
- Wake windows: 1.5-2.5 hours
- Total daytime sleep: 3-4 hours

**Sample schedule:**
- Wake: 7:00 AM
- Nap 1: 8:30 AM (1.5 hour window)
- Nap 2: 12:00 PM
- Nap 3: 3:30 PM
- (Possible Nap 4): 5:00 PM (short - just to bridge to bedtime)
- Bedtime: 7:00 PM

**What's normal:**
- Short naps (30-45 mins) are developmentally normal at this age
- Nap 1 is usually the best nap
- Last nap is often a "bridge" nap (just 20-30 mins)

**Focus on:**
- Watching wake windows carefully
- Offering 4 nap opportunities
- Not stressing about nap length yet

**The truth:** Nap consolidation (longer naps) often doesn't happen until 6+ months. Focus on independent falling asleep first.
