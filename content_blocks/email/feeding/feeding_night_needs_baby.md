## Night Feeds at 4-6 Months: What to Know

At this age, your baby may genuinely need 1-2 night feeds. That's developmentally normal.

**How to handle necessary night feeds:**
- Feed when needed, but put baby back down AWAKE
- Don't feed to sleep - that's the habit we're breaking
- Keep the feed boring: lights dim, no talking, no play
- Back in crib drowsy but eyes open

**Signs of true hunger vs. habit:**
- **Hunger:** Takes a full feed (10+ mins nursing, 4+ oz bottle)
- **Habit:** Comfort sucks for a few minutes and falls asleep

**The approach:**
- Keep legitimate night feeds for now
- Focus on bedtime and the put-down
- Night weaning comes later (if pediatrician approves)

**What to expect:**
- Night feeds will naturally decrease as daytime eating increases
- By 7+ months, most babies don't need night calories
- For now, feed if needed but don't let them fall asleep during

You're not denying food - you're separating eating from sleeping.
