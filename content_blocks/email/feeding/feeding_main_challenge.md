## Breaking the Feed-to-Sleep Association: This Is Your Day

I know what you're thinking: "But my baby NEEDS to eat before bed." And you're right - feeding before bed is fine.

But there's a difference between **feeding before bed** and **feeding TO sleep**. Today we fix that.

**Why it's happening:**
- Your baby has learned: full belly + drowsy = sleep
- When they wake at night, they look for that same feeling
- They can't separate eating from sleeping

**The impact:**
- Night wakings that require feeding to resettle
- You're exhausted from multiple feeds
- Your baby may be eating at night out of habit, not hunger

**The key change: Move feeding FIRST in your routine**

Instead of: Bath > PJs > Feed (asleep)
Try: Feed > Bath > PJs > Book > Bed (awake)

**Why this works:**
- Creates a buffer between eating and sleeping
- Breaks the association
- Baby learns to fall asleep with a full tummy but open eyes

**Expect protest:**
This is a big change to their routine. They'll be confused. That's normal. Stay consistent and they'll adjust within 3-5 nights.
