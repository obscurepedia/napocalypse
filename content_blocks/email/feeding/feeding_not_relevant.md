## Feeding to Sleep: Quick Guidance

Today's topic is feeding-to-sleep - and since your baby's main association is something else (like rocking or pacifier), this might not be your primary battle.

But the principle is the same: **we're removing the last "crutch" before sleep**.

**Check-in:**
Even if feeding isn't your main issue, ask yourself:
- Does feeding happen right before crib?
- Does your baby fall asleep during the bedtime feed?
- Do you feed during night wakings?

If yes to any: move the feed earlier in the routine and read today's content carefully.

**The principle:**
Whatever happens right before sleep becomes the association. If that's feeding, your baby will look for it every time they wake.

Read through today's strategies. The logic applies to breaking any sleep dependency.
