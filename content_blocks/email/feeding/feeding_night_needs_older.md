## Night Feeds at 7+ Months: Habit or Hunger?

Here's the truth: at 7+ months, most healthy babies don't NEED night feeds nutritionally. Their stomachs can hold enough, and they can go 10-12 hours without eating.

**So why are they waking to feed?**
- Habit: their body expects calories at 1 AM, so they wake "hungry"
- Association: feeding is how they fall back asleep
- Comfort: nursing/bottle = soothing

**How to know if it's habit:**
- Quick feed, falls right back asleep
- Same wake times every night
- Feeding during the day is adequate

**The fix:**
- Move bedtime feed earlier (break association)
- Consider night weaning (tomorrow's topic)
- Apply your method to night wakings instead of feeding

**What to expect:**
- They may wake at the "usual" times expecting food
- Use your method instead of feeding
- Within a week, the habit wakes should stop

**Check with pediatrician first** - but for most healthy 7+ month olds, those night feeds are serving comfort, not nutrition.
