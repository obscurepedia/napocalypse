# Sleep Foundations for Your 0-3 Month Old

Welcome to the newborn phase! This is one of the most challenging yet magical times in your parenting journey. If you're reading this at 2 AM while your baby sleeps on your chest, or after yet another 45-minute "nap" that ended in tears, you're in the right place.

Here's the most important thing you need to know right now: **Newborns cannot be sleep trained.** And that's not just okay—it's exactly how it should be.

## What's Happening Developmentally

Your newborn's sleep is fundamentally different from older babies and adults. Understanding this will help you set realistic expectations and reduce stress:

**Sleep Duration:**
- Newborns sleep 14-17 hours per day
- Sleep is broken into 2-4 hour chunks
- They literally cannot sleep longer stretches yet
- This is biological, not behavioral

**Sleep Cycles:**
- Newborn sleep cycles are 45-60 minutes (vs 90-120 minutes for adults)
- They spend 50% of sleep in active (REM) sleep
- This means they wake easily and frequently
- They can't connect sleep cycles independently yet

**No Circadian Rhythm:**
- Newborns don't have a day/night rhythm until 6-12 weeks
- Their internal clock isn't developed yet
- They don't produce melatonin on a schedule
- This is why they can be wide awake at 3 AM

## Your Newborn's Sleep Needs

**Total Sleep:** 14-17 hours in 24 hours
**Longest Stretch:** 2-4 hours (longer is a bonus, not an expectation)
**Wake Windows:** 45-90 minutes (including feeding time)

If your newborn wakes every 2 hours, only sleeps while held, or has days and nights mixed up—all of this is completely normal. You're not doing anything wrong.

## Building Healthy Foundations

While you can't sleep train yet, you can start building foundations:

**Create Sleep-Friendly Environment:**
- Room temperature: 68-72°F (20-22°C)
- Darkness for naps and night (blackout curtains help)
- White noise: Consistent sound mimics the womb
- Safe sleep space: Firm mattress, fitted sheet, nothing else

**Start Gentle Routines:**
- Simple bedtime routine (diaper, feeding, swaddle/sleep sack)
- Consistent response to night wakings
- Practice putting baby down awake (when alert but calm)
- Watch for early sleep cues (yawning, fussiness, rubbing eyes)

**Day/Night Distinction:**
- Bright light and activity during day feeds
- Dim lighting and quiet voices for night feeds
- Keep night feeds businesslike (minimal interaction)

## Common Newborn Sleep Patterns

**Normal patterns include:**
- Waking every 1-3 hours to feed
- Sleeping only when held or on someone
- Difficulty settling without movement
- 45-minute naps (one sleep cycle)
- Fussy periods in the evening
- Mixed up days and nights initially

**None of these are problems to fix—they're normal newborn behavior.**

## Survival Tips for Parents

**Rest When You Can:**
- Sleep when baby sleeps (really!)
- Accept help with household tasks
- Take shifts with your partner if possible

**Lower Your Expectations:**
- The house can be messy
- Meals can be simple
- Your only job is to care for baby and yourself

**This Phase is Temporary:**
- Most babies begin showing more predictable patterns by 8-12 weeks
- Real sleep training becomes possible around 4-6 months
- You will sleep again!

## When to Seek Help

Contact your pediatrician if:
- Baby consistently sleeps less than 14 hours total
- Baby is difficult to wake for feeds
- You notice significant changes in sleep patterns
- You're feeling overwhelmed or depressed

Remember: This intense phase doesn't last forever. Focus on bonding, healing, and surviving these early weeks. Real sleep improvements will come naturally as your baby's nervous system matures.
