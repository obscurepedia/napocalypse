# Sleep Foundations for Your 4-6 Month Old

Your baby is entering one of the most exciting windows for sleep development. Between 4-6 months, most babies develop the neurological maturity to sleep for longer stretches and begin consolidating their sleep cycles. This is often called the "sweet spot" for introducing healthy sleep habits.

## What's Happening Developmentally

At this age, your baby's circadian rhythm is maturing. They're starting to produce melatonin (the sleep hormone) in a predictable pattern, with levels rising in the evening and falling in the morning. Their sleep cycles are also lengthening from 45-50 minutes to closer to 60 minutes, making it easier for them to link cycles together.

Most 4-6 month olds need 14-15 hours of total sleep in a 24-hour period, typically broken down as:
- **Nighttime sleep**: 10-12 hours (with 1-3 feedings)
- **Daytime naps**: 3-4 hours across 3-4 naps

## Your Baby's Sleep Readiness

At this age, your baby is likely showing signs they're ready for more independent sleep:
- They can self-soothe by sucking on their hands or fingers
- They're becoming more aware of their surroundings and may fight sleep to stay engaged
- They're starting to roll or show other motor milestones
- They may be experiencing the 4-month sleep regression (temporary disruption as sleep patterns mature)

## Setting Up for Success

**Create a Sleep-Friendly Environment:**
- Room temperature: 68-72°F (20-22°C)
- Darkness: Use blackout curtains or shades (even for naps)
- White noise: Consistent sound at 50-60 decibels
- Safe sleep space: Firm mattress, fitted sheet, nothing else in the crib

**Establish Predictable Wake Windows:**
At 4-6 months, your baby can typically stay awake for:
- First wake window: 1.5-2 hours
- Middle wake windows: 1.75-2.25 hours  
- Last wake window: 2-2.5 hours

Watch for sleepy cues (rubbing eyes, yawning, fussiness) but don't wait until your baby is overtired.

**Develop a Consistent Bedtime Routine:**
A 20-30 minute routine signals to your baby that sleep is coming. This might include:
1. Bath (not necessary every night)
2. Massage or gentle play
3. Pajamas and fresh diaper
4. Feeding (try to keep this early in the routine)
5. Book or song
6. Into sleep space while drowsy but awake

The key is consistency - same order, same timing, every night.

## Common Challenges at This Age

**The 4-Month Sleep Regression**: If your baby suddenly starts waking more frequently, taking short naps, or fighting sleep, they're likely going through the 4-month regression. This is actually a progression - their sleep is maturing into adult-like patterns. It typically lasts 2-4 weeks.

**Rolling Over**: Once your baby can roll, stop swaddling immediately. Transition to a sleep sack with arms free. Some babies will roll onto their stomach and get "stuck" - practice tummy time during the day to build strength.

**Increased Awareness**: Your baby is becoming more interested in the world, which can make them resist sleep. A consistent routine and sleep-friendly environment become even more important.

## What to Expect

With the right foundations in place, most 4-6 month olds can:
- Sleep 10-12 hours at night with 1-3 feedings
- Take 3-4 naps totaling 3-4 hours
- Fall asleep within 10-20 minutes of being put down
- Link some sleep cycles (though short naps are still normal)

Remember: Every baby is different. These are guidelines, not rules. Your baby's individual temperament, feeding needs, and development will influence their sleep patterns.
