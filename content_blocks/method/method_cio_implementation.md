# Implementing Cry-It-Out: Your Step-by-Step Action Plan

You've decided to use the CIO method. Now it's time to put it into action. This guide will walk you through exactly what to do, night by night, to successfully teach your baby to sleep independently.

## Pre-Training Preparation (Days 1-3)

Before you start CIO, set yourself up for success:

### Day 1-2: Optimize the Sleep Environment

**Make the room perfect for sleep:**
- Install blackout curtains or shades (test during daytime - should be dark enough you can't see your hand)
- Set up white noise machine (50-60 decibels, continuous sound)
- Check room temperature (68-72°F is ideal)
- Remove all items from crib except fitted sheet
- Ensure crib mattress is firm and properly fitted

**Safety check:**
- Smoke detector working
- Baby monitor positioned to see baby clearly
- No cords or hazards near crib
- Room is baby-proofed

### Day 2-3: Establish Your Bedtime Routine

Create a consistent 20-30 minute routine you'll do every night:

**Sample routine:**
1. Bath (if doing that night) - 5-10 minutes
2. Massage or gentle play - 5 minutes
3. Pajamas and fresh diaper - 5 minutes
4. Feeding (keep this early in routine) - 10-15 minutes
5. Brush gums/teeth - 2 minutes
6. Book or song in dim light - 5 minutes
7. Into crib awake - lights out

**Key principles:**
- Same order every night
- Same timing every night
- End with baby going into crib awake (this is crucial)
- Keep it calm and boring (not exciting playtime)
- Do the routine in baby's room (or end there)

### Day 3: Remove All Sleep Associations

**Identify what helps your baby fall asleep:**
- Rocking or bouncing
- Feeding to sleep
- Pacifier
- Being held
- Patting or shushing

**Remove them all at once:**
- Don't do "gradual" removal - it prolongs the process
- Feed at the beginning of the routine, not the end
- If using pacifier, remove it completely (or don't replace when it falls out)
- Put baby down awake - not drowsy, AWAKE

**Why all at once?**
Removing one association at a time means multiple rounds of crying and confusion. Rip the band-aid off - it's kinder in the long run.

## Choosing Your CIO Approach

### Option 1: Full Extinction (Classic CIO)

**Best for:**
- Parents who can handle it emotionally
- Babies who escalate with check-ins
- Families who want fastest results

**The process:**
1. Complete bedtime routine
2. Put baby in crib awake
3. Say goodnight ("I love you, it's time for sleep")
4. Leave the room
5. Don't return until morning (or next scheduled feeding)

**What about check-ins?**
None. You don't go back in unless:
- Baby is sick or injured
- Baby has vomited
- Baby is stuck in an unsafe position
- It's time for a scheduled feeding (if still doing night feeds)

### Option 2: Graduated Extinction (Ferber Method)

**Best for:**
- Parents who need reassurance baby is okay
- First-time sleep trainers
- Babies who respond well to brief check-ins

**The check-in schedule:**

**Night 1:**
- First check: 3 minutes
- Second check: 5 minutes
- All subsequent checks: 10 minutes

**Night 2:**
- First check: 5 minutes
- Second check: 10 minutes
- All subsequent checks: 12 minutes

**Night 3:**
- First check: 10 minutes
- Second check: 12 minutes
- All subsequent checks: 15 minutes

**Night 4+:**
- Continue increasing intervals or maintain 15 minutes

**Check-in rules (CRITICAL):**
- Keep it brief: 30-60 seconds maximum
- Don't pick up baby
- Don't turn on lights
- Use a calm, boring voice: "It's time for sleep. I love you. Goodnight."
- Pat or touch briefly if you want, but don't linger
- Leave even if baby is still crying
- Set a timer - don't go back early

**Why brief check-ins?**
You're reassuring yourself baby is okay, not soothing baby to sleep. If you stay too long or engage too much, you become part of the sleep process again.

## Night-by-Night Expectations

### Night 1: The Hardest Night

**What to expect:**
- 30-90 minutes of crying (average is 45 minutes)
- Crying may be intense
- Baby may stand up, sit up, or move around
- You'll feel terrible (this is normal)

**What to do:**
- Follow your chosen method exactly
- Set a timer for check-ins (if using Ferber)
- Distract yourself (movie, project, shower)
- Support each other (if you have a partner)
- Keep a log: note when baby went down, when crying started/stopped

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't watch the monitor constantly (check periodically)
- Don't give in and go get baby
- Don't second-guess yourself
- Don't start and stop (commit to at least 3 nights)

**Overnight wakings:**
- Use the same approach as bedtime
- If baby needs a feeding, feed quickly and put back down awake
- Don't engage or turn on lights

### Night 2: The Test

**What to expect:**
- 20-60 minutes of crying (usually less than night 1)
- Possible extinction burst (temporary increase in crying)
- More frequent night wakings (baby is testing if old rules apply)

**What to do:**
- Stay consistent (this is crucial)
- Use the same check-in intervals (or increase slightly)
- Remember: extinction burst means it's working
- Keep logging progress

**If baby cries longer than night 1:**
This is the extinction burst. It's temporary (usually just this one night). Don't give in - you're so close to success.

### Night 3: The Turning Point

**What to expect:**
- 10-30 minutes of crying
- Noticeable improvement
- Longer sleep stretches
- You'll start to feel hopeful

**What to do:**
- Continue being consistent
- Celebrate the progress
- Keep following the same routine and approach

### Nights 4-7: Solidifying the Skill

**What to expect:**
- Crying decreases to 5-15 minutes
- Baby falls asleep faster each night
- Sleeping longer stretches
- Occasional tough nights (this is normal)

**What to do:**
- Maintain consistency
- Don't change anything that's working
- If baby has a rough night, don't panic - stay the course

### Week 2+: The New Normal

**What to expect:**
- Baby falls asleep within 5-10 minutes with minimal fussing
- Sleeping through the night (or waking only for necessary feeds)
- Naps start improving
- Everyone is better rested

**What to do:**
- Maintain your routine and schedule
- Handle setbacks consistently (illness, travel, etc.)
- Gradually reduce night feedings if appropriate

## Handling Specific Situations

### If Baby Stands Up or Sits Up

**What to do:**
- If using Ferber: During check-ins, you can lay baby back down once
- If using full extinction: Don't go in
- Baby will eventually lie down when tired
- This usually resolves by night 2-3

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't keep going in to lay baby down (this becomes a game)
- Don't stress - baby will figure it out

### If Baby Vomits

**What to do:**
- Go in immediately
- Clean up quickly and calmly
- Change sheets/pajamas if needed
- Put baby back down awake
- Leave and continue with your method

**Prevention:**
- Don't feed right before bed
- Ensure baby isn't overtired (this increases likelihood of vomiting)

**Note:** Some babies vomit as a protest. If this happens repeatedly, consult your pediatrician, but don't let it derail sleep training.

### If Baby Poops

**What to do:**
- Wait until baby is asleep or until your next check-in
- Change diaper quickly and silently
- Put baby back down awake
- Leave immediately

**Exception:** If baby has diaper rash or sensitive skin, change immediately.

### If You Have a Partner

**Divide responsibilities:**
- One person does bedtime routine and puts baby down
- Other person handles check-ins (if using Ferber)
- Switch roles each night if desired
- Support each other emotionally

**Stay united:**
- Agree on the approach beforehand
- Don't undermine each other
- If one person is struggling, the other takes over
- Remind each other why you're doing this

### If You're Solo Parenting

**Make it easier:**
- Start on a weekend when you can nap the next day
- Have a support person on call (friend, family) for emotional support
- Prepare distractions (movie queued up, project ready)
- Remember: you can do hard things

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Baby is crying for 2+ hours

**Possible causes:**
- Baby isn't tired enough (wake windows too short)
- Baby is overtired (wake windows too long)
- Sleep environment isn't optimal
- Baby is sick or in pain

**What to do:**
- Check on baby to ensure they're safe
- Evaluate timing and environment
- If baby is genuinely distressed (not just protesting), pause and reassess
- Consult pediatrician if concerned

### No improvement after 5-7 nights

**Possible causes:**
- Inconsistent approach (sometimes intervening, sometimes not)
- Wake windows are off
- Lingering sleep associations
- Medical issue

**What to do:**
- Review your logs - are you being 100% consistent?
- Evaluate schedule and wake windows
- Ensure all sleep associations are removed
- Consult pediatrician to rule out medical issues

### Baby was doing great, now suddenly isn't

**Possible causes:**
- Developmental leap
- Teething
- Illness
- Schedule needs adjustment
- Travel or disruption

**What to do:**
- Stay consistent with your approach
- Adjust schedule if needed (longer wake windows as baby grows)
- Treat illness/teething, but maintain sleep expectations
- Remember: temporary setbacks don't erase progress

## Maintaining Success

### Keep the routine consistent
- Same bedtime every night (within 30 minutes)
- Same routine every night
- Same sleep environment

### Adjust schedule as baby grows
- Wake windows lengthen as baby gets older
- Nap transitions happen (3→2→1 naps)
- Bedtime may shift slightly

### Handle disruptions consistently
- Travel: Bring white noise machine, maintain routine
- Illness: Comfort as needed, but return to normal once well
- Visitors: Maintain schedule and routine
- Daylight saving time: Adjust gradually over 3-4 days

### Trust the skill
- Your baby has learned to self-soothe
- Temporary setbacks don't erase this skill
- Stay consistent and baby will bounce back
