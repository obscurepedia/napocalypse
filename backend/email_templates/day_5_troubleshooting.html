        <h2>🚨 Emergency Troubleshooting: What to Do When...</h2>
        
        <div class="scenario">
            <strong>Scenario:</strong> "my baby has been crying for over an hour. Is this normal?"
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            <strong>✅ What to Do:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Check the basics:</strong> Diaper, temperature, hunger (if it's been 3+ hours since last feed)</li>
                <li><strong>Assess the crying:</strong> Is it protest crying (angry, intermittent) or distress crying (panicked, continuous)?</li>
                <li><strong>If protest crying:</strong> Stay the course. This is normal on nights 1-3.</li>
                <li><strong>If distress crying:</strong> Go in, calm them down, then start over</li>
                <li><strong>Remember:</strong> Crying peaks around 45-60 minutes, then typically decreases</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="scenario">
            <strong>Scenario:</strong> "My baby threw up from crying so hard"
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            <strong>✅ What to Do:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Go in immediately and clean them up calmly and quietly</li>
                <li>Change clothes/sheets if needed</li>
                <li>Offer a small amount of water if appropriate for age</li>
                <li>Put them back down and resume your method</li>
                <li><strong>Important:</strong> This is rare but can happen. It doesn't mean you should stop – just clean up and continue</li>
                <li>If vomiting happens repeatedly, consult your pediatrician</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="scenario">
            <strong>Scenario:</strong> "My baby is standing/sitting in the crib and won't lie down"
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            <strong>✅ What to Do:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>First 2-3 times:</strong> Gently lay them back down without talking</li>
                <li><strong>After that:</strong> Let them figure it out (they will!)</li>
                <li>Don't engage or make it a game</li>
                <li>They'll eventually lie down when tired enough</li>
                <li><strong>During the day:</strong> Practice sitting and lying down as a game</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="scenario">
            <strong>Scenario:</strong> "It's 4:30am and my baby is wide awake and happy"
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            <strong>✅ What to Do:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Do NOT start the day before 6am</strong> – this is crucial!</li>
                <li>Treat it like a night waking: boring, dark, minimal interaction</li>
                <li>Don't turn on lights or start playing</li>
                <li>Use your sleep training method as if it were midnight</li>
                <li>If they won't go back to sleep, keep them in the dark room until 6am</li>
                <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Make sure bedtime isn't too early (7-8pm is ideal)</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="scenario">
            <strong>Scenario:</strong> "My baby is sick/teething – should I continue?"
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            <strong>✅ What to Do:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mild teething:</strong> Continue with your method, offer pain relief before bed</li>
                <li><strong>Fever/illness:</strong> Pause sleep training and provide comfort</li>
                <li><strong>Resume when:</strong> Baby has been symptom-free for 2-3 days</li>
                <li><strong>Good news:</strong> Most babies return to good sleep quickly after a brief pause</li>
                <li>Don't restart from scratch – just pick up where you left off</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="scenario">
            <strong>Scenario:</strong> "My partner went in and picked up the baby against our plan"
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            <strong>✅ What to Do:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Don't panic:</strong> One inconsistency won't ruin everything</li>
                <li>Calmly put baby back down and resume your method</li>
                <li><strong>Tomorrow:</strong> Have a conversation about staying aligned</li>
                <li>Consider having the more committed parent handle bedtime for now</li>
                <li>Remind each other of your "why" – better sleep for everyone</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="scenario">
            <strong>Scenario:</strong> "We're traveling/moving – what do we do?"
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            <strong>✅ What to Do:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>If you haven't started:</strong> Wait until you're settled</li>
                <li><strong>If you're mid-training:</strong> Try to maintain consistency as much as possible</li>
                <li><strong>If sleep is established:</strong> Expect some regression, but it will bounce back</li>
                <li>Bring familiar sleep items (white noise, sleep sack, etc.)</li>
                <li>Resume normal routine as soon as you're back home</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h2>📋 Quick Reference: When to Check vs. When to Wait</h2>
        
        <div class="quick-ref">
            <strong>CHECK IMMEDIATELY IF:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Crying sounds like pain or distress (not protest)</li>
                <li>Baby has vomited</li>
                <li>You hear a loud thump or concerning noise</li>
                <li>Baby is stuck in an unsafe position</li>
                <li>It's been 3+ hours since last feed and baby might be hungry</li>
            </ul>
            
            <strong>WAIT AND OBSERVE IF:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Crying is intermittent protest crying</li>
                <li>Baby is standing/sitting but safe</li>
                <li>It's within your planned check-in interval</li>
                <li>Crying is decreasing in intensity</li>
                <li>Baby is starting to self-soothe (sucking thumb, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>🎯 The 3-Night Rule</h2>
        <p>If you're questioning whether your method is working, ask yourself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have I been 100% consistent for at least 3 nights?</li>
            <li>Is the crying duration decreasing at all?</li>
            <li>Is baby falling asleep faster than night 1?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you answered yes to any of these, <strong>keep going!</strong> Most methods need 3-5 nights to show clear results.</p>
        
        <h2>🛑 When to Stop and Reassess</h2>
        <p>Consider pausing if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Baby is genuinely sick (fever, vomiting, diarrhea)</li>
            <li>You're in the middle of a major life change</li>
            <li>You're not mentally/emotionally ready</li>
            <li>Your gut is telling you something is wrong</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Pausing doesn't mean failing. You can always try again in a few weeks.</p>
