        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>You're on a roll! You've observed the old routine and optimized the sleep space. Today, we'll create a new, predictable bedtime routine that will become a powerful sleep cue for your baby.</p>

        <p>A good routine doesn't need to be long or complicated. The goal is consistency, not complexity. It should be a 15-20 minute wind-down period that you can do every single night.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Goal for Today: The 3-Step Routine</h3>
            <p>Choose three simple, calming activities to do in order before bed. Here is a classic example:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bath or Wipe-Down:</strong> A warm bath or a quick wipe with a warm cloth can be very soothing.</li>
                <li><strong>PJs & Story:</strong> Get into pajamas, and then read one (and only one!) short, boring book in a dim light.</li>
                <li><strong>Feed & Cuddle:</strong> If a feed is part of your routine, do it now. Keep it calm and quiet. End with a brief cuddle and a consistent phrase like, "I love you, it's time to sleep."</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Your Task:</strong> Decide on your 3 steps. Perform them in the same order tonight, and every night from now on. The predictability is what creates the magic.</p>

        <p>This routine will soon be your baby's strongest signal that sleep is coming.</p>
        
        <p>Tomorrow, we'll talk about the foundation of it all: wake windows.</p>
        
        <p>Amazing work!</p>
