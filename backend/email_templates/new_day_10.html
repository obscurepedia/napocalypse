        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>Let's talk about a controversial topic: the pacifier. For some babies, it's a magic sleep aid. For others, it's a sleep crutch that has you playing "binky-pong" all night long, re-inserting it every time it falls out.</p>

        <p>If the pacifier is helping your baby sleep and you don't have to replace it, you don't have a problem! But if it's become a source of constant wakings, it might be time to say goodbye.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Goal for Today: Make a Decision</h3>
            <p>If you've identified the pacifier as a sleep problem, you have two choices: teach your baby to replace it themselves, or get rid of it entirely.</p>
            
            <h4>Option 1: Teach Self-Replacement (for babies 7m+)</h4>
            <p><strong>The Task:</strong> During the day, practice the "pacifier game." Put 5-10 pacifiers in the corner of the crib. Show your baby how to find one and put it in their mouth. Guide their hand to do it themselves. When they wake at night, gently guide their hand to the pile instead of putting it in their mouth for them.</p>

            <h4>Option 2: Go Cold Turkey</h4>
            <p><strong>The Task:</strong> This is the faster, though potentially tougher, option. Decide on a start time (e.g., bedtime tonight) and remove all pacifiers from the house. Be prepared for 1-3 nights of protest. Use your {method} sleep training method to handle the crying. It will be a rough couple of nights, but then it will be over.</p>

        <p>There's no right or wrong answer here. Choose the path that feels most manageable for your family and commit to it.</p>
        
        <p>Tomorrow, we'll cover another common dependency: feeding to sleep.</p>
        
        <p>You're making such thoughtful decisions for your family.</p>
