        <h1>✅ Day 2: Your First Night Checklist</h1>
        <p>Let's Set You Up for Success</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Good morning! ☀️</p>
        
        <p>I hope you've had a chance to read through your personalized sleep guide. Today, we're going to make sure you're 100% ready for your first night of sleep training.</p>
        
        <h2>🎯 Before You Start: The Critical Checklist</h2>
        
        <div class="checklist">
            <div class="checklist-item">
                <strong>☐ Pediatrician Approval</strong><br>
                Have you discussed your sleep training plan with your pediatrician? This is especially important if your baby has any health concerns, was premature, or has feeding issues.
            </div>
            
            <div class="checklist-item">
                <strong>☐ Partner Alignment</strong><br>
                If you have a co-parent, are you both on the same page? Consistency between caregivers is crucial. Have a conversation about the plan and agree on your approach.
            </div>
            
            <div class="checklist-item">
                <strong>☐ Sleep Environment Ready</strong><br>
                • Room is dark (blackout curtains if needed)<br>
                • Temperature is 68-72°F (20-22°C)<br>
                • White noise machine is set up<br>
                • Crib/sleep space is safe (no loose blankets, toys, or bumpers)
            </div>
            
            <div class="checklist-item">
                <strong>☐ Bedtime Routine Established</strong><br>
                Have you created a consistent 20-30 minute bedtime routine? This should be calming and predictable (bath, pajamas, book, song, etc.)
            </div>
            
            <div class="checklist-item">
                <strong>☐ Start Date Chosen</strong><br>
                Pick a night when:<br>
                • You can commit to 3-5 nights of consistency<br>
                • No travel or major changes are coming<br>
                • You're mentally prepared (not exhausted from a terrible night)<br>
                • Ideally on a Friday or Saturday so you can recover over the weekend
            </div>
            
            <div class="checklist-item">
                <strong>☐ Backup Plan Ready</strong><br>
                Know what you'll do if things don't go as planned. Review the troubleshooting section of your guide.
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>⏰ Timing is Everything</h2>
        <p>Here's what most parents get wrong: they start sleep training when they're at their breaking point. But the best time to start is when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your baby is healthy (no illness, teething, or developmental leaps)</li>
            <li>You have 3-5 consecutive nights to be consistent</li>
            <li>You're mentally prepared for some crying and tough moments</li>
            <li>Your support system is in place</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>💡 Real Talk:</strong> The first 3 nights are the hardest. After that, most babies show significant improvement. If you can push through those first few nights with consistency, you'll be amazed at the results.
        </div>
        
        <h2>📱 Track Your Progress</h2>
        <p>I recommend keeping a simple sleep log for the first week:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bedtime</li>
            <li>How long it took to fall asleep</li>
            <li>Number of night wakings</li>
            <li>Wake-up time</li>
            <li>Any notes about what worked or didn't work</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This helps you see patterns and progress, even when it doesn't feel like things are improving.</p>
        
        <h2>🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> Switching methods mid-week confuses your baby</li>
            <li><strong>Starting too late:</strong> An overtired baby is harder to train</li>
            <li><strong>Giving up too soon:</strong> Most methods need 3-5 nights to show results</li>
            <li><strong>Not having a plan for night wakings:</strong> Know exactly what you'll do at 2am</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>💪 You're Ready!</h2>
        <p>If you've checked off everything on the list above, you're ready to start. Remember: this is an investment in your entire family's wellbeing. Better sleep means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A happier, healthier baby</li>
            <li>Better mood and cognitive development</li>
            <li>More patience and energy for you</li>
            <li>A stronger relationship with your partner</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Tomorrow</strong>, I'll share the most common challenges parents face in the first few nights and exactly how to handle them.</p>
        
        <p>You've got this! 💪</p>
