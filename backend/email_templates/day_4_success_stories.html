        <p>You're Not Alone – Here's Proof!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hi there! 👋</p>
        
        <p>Today, I want to share something special with you: <strong>real stories from real parents</strong> who were exactly where you are right now.</p>
        
        <p>These aren't cherry-picked perfect scenarios. These are parents who struggled, doubted themselves, almost gave up... and then everything changed.</p>
        
        <h2>🌟 Sarah's Story: From 8 Wake-Ups to Sleeping Through</h2>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>The Challenge:</h3>
            <p><strong>Baby:</strong> Emma, 7 months old<br>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Waking 6-8 times per night, would only sleep while nursing<br>
            <strong>Parents' state:</strong> Sarah was getting 3-4 hours of broken sleep, considering quitting her job</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "I was so sleep-deprived I couldn't think straight. My husband and I were fighting constantly. I felt like I was failing as a mom because I couldn't 'just deal with it' like everyone said I should."
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Breakthrough:</h3>
            <p>Sarah used the CIO method to break the feed-to-sleep cycle. Here's a quick preview:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Night 1:</strong> 45 minutes of crying (almost gave up)</li>
                <li><strong>Night 2:</strong> Worse – 90 minutes (husband wanted to stop)</li>
                <li><strong>Night 3:</strong> Only 20 minutes of fussing!</li>
                <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Sleeping 11 hours straight, happy baby</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="stats">
                <strong>Final Results:</strong><br>
                From 8 wake-ups → 0 wake-ups<br>
                From 3 hours of sleep → 8 hours of sleep<br>
                From barely functioning → Got a promotion at work!

        <h2>🌟 Rachel's Story: Breaking Feed-to-Sleep Gently</h2>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>The Challenge:</h3>
            <p><strong>Baby:</strong> Ethan, 8 months old<br>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Would only sleep while nursing, waking 6-8 times per night<br>
            <strong>Parents' goal:</strong> Break the association without cry-it-out</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "I couldn't do cry-it-out. It didn't align with my parenting values. I needed a gentler approach, even if it took longer."
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Gentle Solution:</h3>
            <p>Rachel used gradual weaning and the "pantley pull-off" technique:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Separated nursing from falling asleep at bedtime</li>
                <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Used pull-off technique to reduce nursing duration</li>
                <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Gradual night weaning of non-hunger sessions</li>
                <li><strong>Final result:</strong> Sleeping 11+ hours with one feed</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="stats">
                <strong>Final Results (3 weeks):</strong><br>
                From 8 nursing sessions → 1 feeding<br>
                From 2-3 hours of sleep → 7+ hours<br>

        <h2>🌟 Lisa's Story: From 30-Minute Naps to 2-Hour Sleeps</h2>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>The Challenge:</h3>
            <p><strong>Baby:</strong> Owen, 7 months old<br>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Every nap was exactly 30 minutes, cranky and overtired all day<br>
            <strong>Parents' state:</strong> Couldn't get anything done, baby was miserable</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "I could set my watch by it. 30 minutes on the dot, he'd wake up crying. I felt like I was failing him."
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Nap Training Breakthrough:</h3>
            <p>Lisa used CIO specifically for naps with amazing results:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> 42 minutes of crying, 35-minute nap (slight improvement!)</li>
                <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> 15 minutes of crying, 1 hour 10 minutes nap (first long nap!)</li>
                <li><strong>Day 7:</strong> 5 minutes of fussing, 2+ hour naps consistently</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="stats">
                <strong>Final Results (1 week):</strong><br>
                From 30-minute naps → 2+ hour naps<br>
                From cranky baby → Happy, well-rested baby<br>
                From no free time → 2+ hours to herself!

            <strong>Problem:</strong> Single mom, no support system, baby waking every 90 minutes<br>
            <strong>Parents' state:</strong> Priya was having panic attacks from sleep deprivation</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "I had no one to help me. I was doing this alone, working full-time, and barely functioning. I thought sleep training was impossible without a partner."
            </div>
            
            <h3>What Happened:</h3>
            <p>Priya used the modified CIO method with extended check-ins:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Took a Friday off work to recover from the first night</li>
                <li>Asked a friend to check in via text for moral support</li>
                <li>Followed the plan exactly, even when it was hard</li>
                <li>Reminded herself: "I'm teaching him a skill, not abandoning him"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="stats">
                <strong>Results After 4 Nights:</strong><br>
                From waking every 90 min → Sleeping 6-hour stretches<br>
                From panic attacks → Feeling like herself again<br>
                From barely functioning → Thriving at work
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "I did it alone, and if I can do it, anyone can. Aiden is happier, I'm healthier, and I finally feel like a good mom again. Sleep training saved my life – literally."
        
        <h2>💪 What These Stories Teach Us</h2>
        
        <p><strong>1. Night 2-3 is usually the worst</strong> – Don't give up right before the breakthrough!</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Every situation is different</strong> – But the methods work regardless of your circumstances</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Consistency is everything</strong> – The parents who succeeded stuck with their plan</p>
        
        <p><strong>4. It's okay to feel guilty</strong> – But remember you're doing this FOR your baby, not TO your baby</p>
        
        <p><strong>5. The transformation is real</strong> – Better sleep changes everything: mood, development, family dynamics</p>
