        <h1>🛠️ Day 3: Common Gentle Method Challenges</h1>
        <p>Let's Troubleshoot Together</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hi {customer_name}! 👋</p>
        
        <p>You're on night 3 of using the <strong>Gentle/No-Cry method</strong>. How's it going?</p>
        
        <p>By now, you've probably encountered at least one of these common gentle method challenges. Don't worry - they're completely normal, and I've got solutions for you.</p>
        
        <h2>🔥 Top 3 Gentle Method Challenges (And Quick Fixes)</h2>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <h3>Challenge #1: "Progress feels SO slow"</h3>
            <p><strong>Why this happens:</strong> The gentle method is gradual by design. You're making tiny changes each night, so progress isn't as dramatic as faster methods.</p>
            <p><strong>Quick fix:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Track your progress in writing - you'll see changes you might miss otherwise</li>
                <li>Celebrate small wins: "They fell asleep 5 minutes faster tonight!"</li>
                <li>Remember: slow progress is still progress</li>
                <li>Most gentle method families see significant improvement by week 2-3</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What to expect:</strong> You should see 10-20% improvement each week. By week 3, most babies are sleeping much better.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <h3>Challenge #2: "I'm not sure if I'm doing it right"</h3>
            <p><strong>Why this happens:</strong> The gentle method requires more judgment calls than strict methods. You're constantly deciding "Should I intervene now or wait a bit longer?"</p>
            <p><strong>Quick fix:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trust your instincts - you know your baby best</li>
                <li>Follow the "wait and see" rule: pause for 30 seconds before responding</li>
                <li>Be consistent with your chosen approach (pick-up-put-down, fading, etc.)</li>
                <li>Give each strategy at least 5-7 nights before changing</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <h3>Challenge #3: "They're still waking frequently at night"</h3>
            <p><strong>Why this happens:</strong> Night wakings often take longer to improve with gentle methods because you're not doing "cold turkey" changes.</p>
            <p><strong>Quick fix:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Focus on bedtime first - once that's solid, night wakings improve</li>
                <li>Gradually reduce your intervention at each waking</li>
                <li>Keep night interactions boring and brief</li>
                <li>Be patient - night wakings typically improve 1-2 weeks after bedtime</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>💪 You're Doing Great!</h2>
        <p>The gentle method requires patience and consistency. You're teaching your baby new skills gradually, which means less crying but more time. That's a trade-off many parents prefer.</p>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <h3>🎯 Tonight's Action Plan:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Continue your consistent bedtime routine</li>
                <li>Make one small reduction in your support (less rocking, shorter feeding, etc.)</li>
                <li>Use your chosen soothing method consistently</li>
                <li>Track what you did and how long it took</li>
                <li>Remind yourself: "Slow and steady wins the race."</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h2>📊 What to Track Tonight:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What support did you provide? (rocking, patting, feeding, etc.)</li>
            <li>How long did it take to fall asleep?</li>
            <li>How many night wakings?</li>
            <li>What did you do at each waking?</li>
            <li>Any improvements from last night?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data helps you see the gradual progress you're making.</p>
