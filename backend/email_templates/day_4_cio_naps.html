        <h1>⭐ Day 4: Lisa's CIO Success Story</h1>
        <p>Fixing Short Naps (Just Like You!)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hi {customer_name}! 👋</p>
        
        <p>You're on night 4 - and I have some good news: this is usually when things start clicking.</p>
        
        <p>Today, I want to share Lisa's story. She was in your exact situation: using <strong>Cry-It-Out to fix short naps</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>📖 Lisa's Story: From 30-Minute Naps to 2-Hour Stretches</h3>
            
            <p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
            <p>Lisa's 5-month-old son, Owen, was the king of short naps. Every single nap was exactly 30-45 minutes. He'd wake up cranky and overtired, but wouldn't go back to sleep.</p>
            
            <p>Lisa spent her entire day trying to get Owen to nap, only to have him wake up after 30 minutes. She couldn't get anything done, and Owen was constantly fussy from being overtired.</p>
            
            <p>"I felt like I was failing at naps," Lisa said. "Everyone else's baby napped for 2 hours. Mine wouldn't even make it to 45 minutes."</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong></p>
            <p>Day 1: Owen cried for 40 minutes before his first nap. Then slept for only 35 minutes. Lisa was devastated.</p>
            <p>Day 2: 30 minutes of crying. Naps were still only 40-45 minutes. Lisa thought it wasn't working.</p>
            <p>Day 3: 25 minutes of crying. One nap was 55 minutes (progress!), but the others were still short.</p>
            
            <p>"I was ready to give up," Lisa told me. "The crying was hard, and the naps weren't getting longer."</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Turning Point:</strong></p>
            <p>Day 4: Owen cried for only 15 minutes before his first nap. Then slept for 90 minutes straight!</p>
            
            <p>Day 5: Minimal fussing. Two naps were over an hour each.</p>
            
            <p>Day 6: Owen was taking two solid 1.5-2 hour naps per day.</p>
            
            <p>Day 7: Consistent long naps. Owen was happier, less fussy, and sleeping better at night too.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Result:</strong></p>
            <p>Within 2 weeks, Owen was taking two 1.5-2 hour naps every day. Lisa could finally get things done during nap time. Owen was happier and less cranky because he was well-rested.</p>
            
            <p>"I didn't realize how much short naps were affecting everything," Lisa said. "Once his naps got longer, nighttime sleep improved too. It was a game-changer."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>💡 What Lisa's Story Teaches Us</h2>
        
        <p><strong>1. Naps take longer to fix than bedtime.</strong> Don't expect immediate results. Day 4-5 is when you'll see the breakthrough.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Short naps are a skill issue, not a biological limit.</strong> Your baby CAN nap longer - they just need to learn how to connect sleep cycles.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Better naps = better nights.</strong> Once Owen's naps improved, his nighttime sleep got even better.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4. Consistency is key with naps.</strong> Lisa put Owen down at the same times every day, even when naps were still short.</p>
        
        <h2>🎯 Your Action Plan for Today</h2>
        
        <p>Based on Lisa's experience, here's what to do today:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Stick to consistent nap times</strong> - Same times every day, even if naps are still short</li>
            <li><strong>Put baby down awake for naps</strong> - Just like bedtime</li>
            <li><strong>Leave them for the full nap window</strong> - Even if they wake at 30 minutes, give them 10-15 minutes to try to go back to sleep</li>
            <li><strong>Watch for the breakthrough</strong> - Day 4-5 is when naps typically start extending</li>
            <li><strong>Be patient</strong> - Naps are harder than nighttime sleep</li>
        </ol>
