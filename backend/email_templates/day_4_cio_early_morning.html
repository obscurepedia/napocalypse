        <h1>⭐ Day 4: Tom's CIO Success Story</h1>
        <p>Fixing Early Morning Wakes (Just Like You!)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hi {customer_name}! 👋</p>
        
        <p>You're on night 4 - and I have some good news: this is usually when things start clicking.</p>
        
        <p>Today, I want to share Tom's story. He was in your exact situation: using <strong>Cry-It-Out to fix early morning wakes</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>📖 Tom's Story: From 5am Wake-Ups to Sleeping Until 7am</h3>
            
            <p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
            <p>Tom's 7-month-old daughter, Mia, was waking up at 5am every single morning. Like clockwork. She'd be wide awake, ready to start the day, while Tom and his wife were exhausted.</p>
            
            <p>They tried everything: blackout curtains, white noise, earlier bedtime, later bedtime. Nothing worked. Mia was up at 5am no matter what.</p>
            
            <p>"I felt like a zombie," Tom said. "I couldn't function on 5am wake-ups every day. I needed my mornings back."</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong></p>
            <p>Night 1: Mia woke at 5am as usual. Tom left her in the crib. She cried for 45 minutes, then fell back asleep until 6:15am.</p>
            <p>Night 2: Woke at 5am again. Cried for 35 minutes, slept until 6:30am.</p>
            <p>Night 3: Woke at 5:15am. Cried for 30 minutes, slept until 6:45am. Tom was seeing progress but it was slow.</p>
            
            <p>"I kept thinking, 'Is this even working? She's still waking up early,'" Tom told me.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Turning Point:</strong></p>
            <p>Night 4: Mia woke at 5:30am, fussed for 10 minutes, then fell back asleep until 7am!</p>
            
            <p>Night 5: Woke at 5:45am, barely fussed, slept until 7:15am.</p>
            
            <p>Night 6: Slept straight through until 6:50am.</p>
            
            <p>Night 7: Slept until 7am without any early morning wake-up.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Result:</strong></p>
            <p>Within 2 weeks, Mia was consistently sleeping until 6:45-7:15am. Tom got his mornings back. He could exercise, have coffee in peace, and start his day feeling human.</p>
            
            <p>"I didn't realize how much those early wake-ups were affecting my entire day," Tom said. "Now I'm a better dad because I'm not exhausted and resentful every morning."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>💡 What Tom's Story Teaches Us</h2>
        
        <p><strong>1. Early morning wakes take longer to fix.</strong> It's not an overnight fix. But you'll see gradual progress each day.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. The wake time gradually shifts later.</strong> Tom saw 15-30 minute improvements each day until Mia was sleeping until 7am.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Consistency is crucial.</strong> Tom treated 5am wake-ups the same as middle-of-the-night wake-ups - no interaction, lights off, boring.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4. Your baby CAN sleep later.</strong> 5am isn't a biological wake time. It's a learned habit that can be changed.</p>
        
        <h2>🎯 Your Action Plan for Tonight</h2>
        
        <p>Based on Tom's experience, here's what to do:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Set your "wake time" goal</strong> - Choose 6:30am or 7am as your target</li>
            <li><strong>Treat early wake-ups like night wakings</strong> - Dark room, no interaction, boring</li>
            <li><strong>Don't get baby up before your goal time</strong> - Even if they're awake, leave them until your target time</li>
            <li><strong>Track the gradual improvement</strong> - You should see wake time shift 15-30 minutes later each day</li>
            <li><strong>Be patient</strong> - This takes 5-7 days to fully resolve</li>
        </ol>
