        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>Yesterday we broke the "feed to sleep" association. But what about feeds that happen in the middle of the night? Are they for hunger or for comfort?</p>

        <p>First, always check with your pediatrician to ensure your baby is ready for night weaning from a health and weight perspective. For most healthy babies over 6 months, night feeds are more about habit than hunger.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Goal for Today: Make a Plan</h3>
            <p>If you and your doctor have decided it's time to night wean, the key is to do it gradually and predictably.</p>

            <h4>Option 1: Reduce the Time</h4>
            <p><strong>The Task:</strong> If you are breastfeeding, reduce the time of each night feed by 2 minutes every two nights. If you are bottle-feeding, reduce the amount by 1 ounce every two nights. Continue until the feed is gone completely.</p>
            <p><em>Example (Breastfeeding): Night 1&2 = 8 mins. Night 3&4 = 6 mins. Night 5&6 = 4 mins...</em></p>

            <h4>Option 2: The "5/3/3" Rule</h4>
            <p><strong>The Task:</strong> This is a great way to allow for feeds while still encouraging long stretches of sleep. Plan to only feed after a certain amount of time has passed. A common starting point is 5 hours after bedtime, then 3 hours after that feed, and 3 hours after that one. If your baby wakes before the designated time, use your {method} sleep training technique.</p>

        <p>Choose one method and stick with it. This process gives your baby time to adjust their calories to the daytime and learn that night is for sleep, not for snacking.</p>

        <p>You're navigating this with so much care.</p>
