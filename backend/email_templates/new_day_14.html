        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>

        <p>You made it.</p>

        <p>Fourteen days ago, you were exhausted, uncertain, and maybe wondering if better sleep was even possible for your family. And now look at you.</p>

        <p>I know these two weeks weren't easy. I know there were nights you wanted to give up. I know there were moments you questioned whether you were doing the right thing.</p>

        <p>But you kept going. And that's everything.</p>

        <!-- Challenge-Specific Celebration -->

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #27ae60;">What You've Accomplished</h3>

            <p>In just 14 days, you:</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>Created a sleep environment that actually works</li>
                <li>Built a bedtime routine your child can count on</li>
                <li>Mastered wake windows (no more overtired meltdowns)</li>
                <li>Taught your baby the life-changing skill of independent sleep</li>
                <li>Navigated naps, night wakings, and all the curveballs</li>
                <li>Stayed consistent even when it was hard</li>
            </ul>

            {celebration_challenge_block}

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Most importantly:</strong> You gave yourself permission to prioritize your family's wellbeing. That takes courage.</p>
        </div>

        <p>I want you to take a moment - right now - and acknowledge how far you've come. Not just in sleep training, but as a parent.</p>

        <p>You trusted yourself. You learned new skills. You pushed through doubt. You showed up for your child and for yourself, night after night.</p>

        <p><strong>That's not just good parenting. That's exceptional parenting.</strong></p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">What Happens Next? Your Concrete Maintenance Plan</h3>

            {future_age_block}

            <p><strong>Here's your maintenance plan to protect your progress:</strong></p>

            <div style="background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;">
                <p style="margin: 8px 0; font-weight: bold;">Daily Non-Negotiables (Keep These Consistent):</p>
                <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 8px 0;">
                    <li><strong>Same bedtime routine</strong> - Same order, same location, same 20-30 min duration</li>
                    <li><strong>Cave-dark room + white noise</strong> - Never skip these (even for naps)</li>
                    <li><strong>Put baby down awake</strong> - Even on "easy" nights, don't rock/feed to sleep</li>
                    <li><strong>Age-appropriate wake windows</strong> - Don't stretch or shorten them significantly</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div style="background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;">
                <p style="margin: 8px 0; font-weight: bold;">The 3-Night Rule (When to Worry vs. When to Wait):</p>
                <p style="margin: 8px 0;"><strong>If sleep suddenly gets worse, use this decision tree:</strong></p>
                <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 8px 0;">
                    <li><strong>1 bad night:</strong> Don't change anything. Normal variance. Stick to your routine.</li>
                    <li><strong>2 bad nights in a row:</strong> Review the checklist below to identify possible cause, but don't panic yet.</li>
                    <li><strong>3+ bad nights in a row:</strong> Time to troubleshoot actively. Something has shifted.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div style="background: #FFF9E6; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;">
                <p style="margin: 8px 0; font-weight: bold;">Troubleshooting Checklist (Run Through This When Sleep Gets Rocky):</p>
                <ol style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 8px 0;">
                    <li><strong>Is baby sick or teething?</strong>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
                            <li><strong>If YES:</strong> Offer comfort, but still put them down awake. Don't reintroduce old sleep crutches. This will pass in 3-5 days.</li>
                            <li><strong>If NO:</strong> Move to #2</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Did wake windows change recently?</strong>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
                            <li><strong>If YES:</strong> Babies need longer wake windows as they grow. Check if you need to adjust (refer back to Day 4 email for age ranges).</li>
                            <li><strong>If NO:</strong> Move to #3</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Did you recently travel or have a schedule disruption?</strong>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
                            <li><strong>If YES:</strong> Go back to basics for 3 nights. Rebuild the routine consistency.</li>
                            <li><strong>If NO:</strong> Move to #4</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Did a sleep crutch sneak back in?</strong>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
                            <li><strong>Check:</strong> Are you rocking/feeding/holding to sleep again? Did the pacifier become a crutch? Are you rushing in too quickly at night?</li>
                            <li><strong>If YES:</strong> Remove it immediately using the methods from Days 10-11. Be strict for 3 nights.</li>
                            <li><strong>If NO:</strong> Move to #5</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Is this a developmental leap or sleep regression?</strong>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
                            <li><strong>Common ages:</strong> 4 months, 8-10 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years</li>
                            <li><strong>What to do:</strong> Regressions last 2-4 weeks. Don't change your approach - just ride it out with consistency. Babies learn new skills (rolling, crawling, walking) and their sleep temporarily worsens.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div style="background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;">
                <p style="margin: 8px 0; font-weight: bold;">Common Scenarios + How to Handle Them:</p>
                <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 8px 0;">
                    <li><strong>Vacation/Travel:</strong> Bring white noise machine. Keep bedtime routine identical (even in hotel). Expect 2-3 nights of adjustment when you return home - be strict and it'll bounce back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Illness:</strong> Comfort as needed, but still put baby down awake when possible. Don't bring them into your bed or reintroduce bottles/nursing to sleep. Offer extra cuddles BEFORE putting them down, not as a way to fall asleep.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Change (Daylight Saving):</strong> Shift bedtime by 15 minutes every 2 days until you reach the new time. Don't try to do it all at once.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Sibling/Major Life Change:</strong> Keep baby's routine as stable as possible. Predictability = security during chaos.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Spurts:</strong> Baby may wake extra hungry. Feed if needed, but still put them back down awake (not feeding to sleep). This passes in 2-3 days.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p><strong>When to "Go Back to Basics" (Reset Protocol):</strong></p>
            <p>If you've tried the checklist and sleep is still a mess after 5-7 days, do a 3-night reset:</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Night 1-3:</strong> Pretend it's Day 5 of this program. Be VERY strict with your {method} approach. Don't waver.</li>
                <li><strong>Review Days 2, 3, 4:</strong> Re-read environment, routine, and wake windows emails. Make sure nothing has drifted.</li>
                <li><strong>Remove ALL crutches:</strong> If rocking/feeding/pacifier snuck back, remove them all at once (not gradually).</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Most importantly:</strong> Rough nights don't erase your progress. You've built the foundation. Even if you need to "reset" in the future, it takes 3 nights (not 14) because your baby already learned the skill. Trust yourself. You've got this.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The 14-day sequence is complete, but your inbox access to me isn't going anywhere. Seriously. If you hit a roadblock six months from now, reply to any of these emails. I read them.</p>

        <p>I'm so proud of you. Not just for finishing the program, but for everything you did to get here.</p>

        <p>(And I really hope you're getting at least one full sleep cycle tonight. You've earned it.)</p>
