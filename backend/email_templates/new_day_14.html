        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>You've reached the end of the 14-Day Sleep Coaching Program. Take a moment to look back at where you were two weeks ago. You have given your child an incredible gift: the skill of independent sleep. And you've given yourself the gift of rest and confidence. You should be immensely proud.</p>

        <p>You now have a complete toolkit to handle whatever sleep challenges come your way.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Journey in Review</h3>
            <p>In just 14 days, you have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Established a calming, consistent bedtime routine.</li>
                <li>Mastered wake windows to prevent overtiredness.</li>
                <li>Consistently implemented your chosen sleep training method.</li>
                <li>Learned to troubleshoot naps, regressions, and other challenges.</li>
                <li>Broken dependencies on sleep crutches like feeding or pacifiers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Your Task for Today:</strong> Celebrate! You've earned it. Enjoy the peace and quiet of a sleeping baby. Trust in the skills you've learned and the foundation you've built.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">The Journey Doesn't End Here</h3>
