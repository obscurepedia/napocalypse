        <h1>⭐ Day 4: Chris's Gentle Method Success Story</h1>
        <p>Improving Naps Gradually (Just Like You!)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hi {customer_name}! 👋</p>
        
        <p>You're on day 4 of the gentle method - and I want to share Chris's story. He was in your exact situation: using the <strong>Gentle/No-Cry approach to improve naps</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>📖 Chris's Story: Gradually Extending Short Naps</h3>
            
            <p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
            <p>Chris's 6-month-old daughter, Maya, was taking 30-minute naps. Every. Single. Time. She'd wake up cranky and overtired, but Chris didn't want to use cry-it-out for naps.</p>
            
            <p>"I wanted a gentler approach for naps," Chris said. "Even if it took longer."</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Approach:</strong></p>
            <p>Week 1: Chris focused on consistent nap times and a short nap routine. When Maya woke at 30 minutes, he'd go in and try to help her back to sleep with patting and shushing.</p>
            
            <p>Days 1-4: Maya would sometimes go back to sleep for another 20-30 minutes. Small wins!</p>
            
            <p>Days 5-7: Chris started putting Maya down more awake (not rocked to sleep). She'd fuss for 5-10 minutes but was learning to fall asleep independently.</p>
            
            <p>Week 2: Chris continued the same approach. When Maya woke at 30 minutes, he'd wait 5 minutes before going in (giving her a chance to resettle on her own).</p>
            
            <p>Days 8-10: Maya started resettling herself sometimes! One nap extended to 75 minutes.</p>
            
            <p>Days 11-14: More naps were extending. Maya was taking 1-1.5 hour naps regularly.</p>
            
            <p>Week 3: Chris gradually reduced his intervention. Maya was connecting sleep cycles on her own.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Result:</strong></p>
            <p>By week 4, Maya was consistently taking two 1.5-2 hour naps per day. Chris could finally get things done during nap time. Maya was happier and less fussy because she was well-rested.</p>
            
            <p>"It took a month, but it felt gentle and right," Chris said. "And the results have lasted - no regression."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>💡 What Chris's Story Teaches Us</h2>
        
        <p><strong>1. Naps take longer to fix with gentle methods.</strong> Expect 3-4 weeks, not 3-4 days.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Consistency is key.</strong> Same nap times, same routine, every day.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Gradual independence works.</strong> Each week, Maya needed less help falling asleep and staying asleep.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4. Better naps = happier baby.</strong> Once Maya's naps improved, everything got easier.</p>
        
        <h2>🎯 Your Action Plan for This Week</h2>
        
        <p>Based on Chris's experience, here's what to focus on:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Stick to consistent nap times</strong> - Same times every day</li>
            <li><strong>Put baby down more awake</strong> - Gradually reduce sleep props</li>
            <li><strong>When they wake early, wait 5 minutes</strong> - Give them a chance to resettle</li>
            <li><strong>If they don't resettle, help gently</strong> - Patting, shushing, minimal intervention</li>
            <li><strong>Track your progress</strong> - You'll see gradual improvements</li>
        </ol>
