        <h1>⭐ Day 4: Mike's CIO Success Story</h1>
        <p>Breaking the Rocking Habit (Just Like You!)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hi {customer_name}! 👋</p>
        
        <p>You're on night 4 - and I have some good news: this is usually when things start clicking.</p>
        
        <p>Today, I want to share Mike's story. He was in your exact situation: using <strong>Cry-It-Out to break the rocking/motion dependency</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>📖 Mike's Story: From Rocking for Hours to Independent Sleep</h3>
            
            <p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
            <p>Mike's 6-month-old son, Jake, would only fall asleep while being rocked. Not just a little rocking - we're talking 30-45 minutes of vigorous bouncing on a yoga ball. Every. Single. Time.</p>
            
            <p>Mike's back was killing him. His arms were sore. And Jake was waking 3-4 times per night, needing to be rocked back to sleep each time.</p>
            
            <p>"I felt like a human rocking chair," Mike told me. "I couldn't keep doing this."</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong></p>
            <p>Night 1: Jake cried for 50 minutes. Mike almost caved at minute 40.</p>
            <p>Night 2: 40 minutes of crying. Mike's wife wanted to quit.</p>
            <p>Night 3: 30 minutes of crying, but Jake woke up 5 times (extinction burst). Mike was ready to give up.</p>
            
            <p>"I thought, 'This is making things worse, not better,'" Mike said.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Turning Point:</strong></p>
            <p>Night 4: Jake cried for only 15 minutes at bedtime. Then slept for 5 hours straight.</p>
            
            <p>Night 5: 10 minutes of fussing. Slept 7 hours straight.</p>
            
            <p>Night 6: Jake went down with minimal protest. Slept 9 hours straight.</p>
            
            <p>Night 7: No crying at all. Mike put Jake in the crib awake, walked out, and Jake fell asleep on his own within 5 minutes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Result:</strong></p>
            <p>Within 2 weeks, Jake was sleeping 11-12 hours straight. Mike's back pain disappeared. His evenings were his own again.</p>
            
            <p>"I wish I'd done this months ago," Mike said. "We were both suffering because I thought he NEEDED the rocking. He didn't. He just needed to learn a new skill."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>💡 What Mike's Story Teaches Us</h2>
        
        <p><strong>1. The extinction burst is temporary.</strong> Night 3 was Mike's worst night. Night 4 was his breakthrough.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Your baby doesn't need the motion.</strong> They've just learned to associate it with sleep. They can learn a new association.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Your body will thank you.</strong> Rocking for hours every day takes a physical toll. Teaching independent sleep is self-care.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4. It gets better fast.</strong> Most babies show dramatic improvement by night 4-5 when breaking motion dependency.</p>
        
        <h2>🎯 Your Action Plan for Tonight</h2>
        
        <p>Based on Mike's experience, here's what to do tonight:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Do your bedtime routine WITHOUT rocking</strong> - You can hold baby, but stay still</li>
            <li><strong>Put baby down completely awake</strong> - No drowsy transfer from your arms</li>
            <li><strong>Expect less crying than previous nights</strong> - Night 4 is usually the turning point</li>
            <li><strong>Stay strong with night wakings</strong> - Don't rock them back to sleep</li>
            <li><strong>Trust that they can do this</strong> - Your baby is learning a valuable skill</li>
        </ol>
