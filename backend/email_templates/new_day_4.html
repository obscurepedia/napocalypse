        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>You've built a solid foundation with the sleep space and bedtime routine. Now it's time to introduce the single most important concept in baby sleep: **Wake Windows**.</p>

        <p>A wake window is the amount of time your baby can comfortably stay awake between sleeps. If you miss the window, your baby can become overtired, which ironically makes it *harder* for them to fall asleep and stay asleep.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Goal for Today: Watch the Clock</h3>
            <p>You don't need to be a slave to the clock, but you do need to be aware of it. An age-appropriate wake window is your best friend.</p>
            <p><strong>Your Task:</strong> Based on your baby's age, find your starting wake window below. Today, try to put your baby down for their nap or bedtime *before* this window closes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>4-6 Months:</strong> 1.5 - 2.5 hours</li>
                <li><strong>7-9 Months:</strong> 2 - 3.5 hours</li>
                <li><strong>10-12 Months:</strong> 2.5 - 4 hours</li>
                <li><strong>13-18 Months:</strong> 4 - 6 hours</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your 5-month-old wakes up at 7:00 AM, their first nap should happen around 8:45 AM (a 1.75-hour wake window).</p>
            <p>Start with the shorter end of the range for the first nap of the day, and extend it as the day goes on.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Timing is everything. Putting your baby down at the right time makes it 10x easier for them to fall asleep independently.</p>
        
        <p>Tomorrow, we'll introduce the core of the program: your chosen sleep training method ({method}).</p>
        
        <p>You're building incredible momentum!</p>
