        <h1>🛠️ Day 3: Common CIO Challenges</h1>
        <p>Let's Troubleshoot Together</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hi {customer_name}! 👋</p>
        
        <p>You're on night 3 of using the <strong>Cry-It-Out method</strong>. How's it going?</p>
        
        <p>By now, you've probably encountered at least one of these common CIO challenges. Don't worry - they're completely normal, and I've got solutions for you.</p>
        
        <h2>🔥 Top 3 CIO Challenges (And Quick Fixes)</h2>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <h3>Challenge #1: "The crying is lasting longer than I expected"</h3>
            <p><strong>Why this happens:</strong> Your baby is protesting the change. They're used to your help falling asleep, and they're letting you know they don't like the new system.</p>
            <p><strong>Quick fix:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check your timing - is bedtime too early or too late?</li>
                <li>Ensure the room is dark and cool (68-72°F)</li>
                <li>Double-check your bedtime routine is consistent</li>
                <li>Most importantly: <strong>stay consistent</strong>. Night 3 is often the hardest.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What to expect:</strong> Most babies cry for 30-60 minutes on night 1, 20-40 minutes on night 2, and 10-20 minutes by night 3. If you're seeing this pattern, you're on track!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <h3>Challenge #2: "They're waking up MORE at night, not less"</h3>
            <p><strong>Why this happens:</strong> This is called an "extinction burst" - your baby is trying harder to get your attention before they accept the new routine.</p>
            <p><strong>Quick fix:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Treat night wakings the same as bedtime</li>
                <li>Don't pick up unless it's a safety issue</li>
                <li>Keep the room dark and boring</li>
                <li>This usually peaks on night 2-3 and improves dramatically by night 4-5</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <h3>Challenge #3: "I'm doubting if this is the right method"</h3>
            <p><strong>Why this happens:</strong> Hearing your baby cry is hard. Your instincts are telling you to help. That's normal and shows you're a caring parent.</p>
            <p><strong>Quick fix:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember WHY you're doing this: better sleep = healthier, happier baby</li>
                <li>Review the research: CIO is safe and effective (your guide has the studies)</li>
                <li>Give it the full 5-7 nights before evaluating</li>
                <li>Talk to your partner or support person when you're struggling</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>💪 You're Doing Great!</h2>
        <p>Night 3 is often the hardest night. If you can get through tonight, you're over the hump. Most families see dramatic improvement by night 4-5.</p>

            <p>Sarah was exactly where you are on night 3. Her baby had cried for 90 minutes (the worst night yet), and she almost gave up.</p>
            <p>But night 4? Only 20 minutes of fussing. Night 5? 10 minutes. Week 2? Sleeping 11 hours straight.</p>

            <h3>🎯 Tonight's Action Plan:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stick to your exact bedtime routine</li>
                <li>Put baby down at the same time as previous nights</li>
                <li>If they cry longer than usual, that's normal for night 3</li>
                <li>Treat any night wakings the same way</li>
                <li>Remind yourself: "This is temporary. Better sleep is coming."</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h2>📊 What to Track Tonight:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How long did it take to fall asleep?</li>
            <li>How many night wakings?</li>
            <li>How long did each waking last?</li>
            <li>What time did they wake up for the day?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data helps you see progress even when it doesn't feel like it.</p>
