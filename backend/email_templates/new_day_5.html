        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>This is a big day. You've laid the groundwork perfectly, and now it's time to begin the sleep training process itself. Remember, you chose the <strong>{method}</strong> approach because it felt right for you and your family. Trust that instinct.</p>

        <p>The key to success is 100% consistency. It will be challenging, but you can do this. The goal is to give your baby the space to learn the incredible skill of falling asleep on their own.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Goal for Today: The First Night</h3>
            <p>Tonight, you will put your baby down in their crib **awake** and follow the steps of your chosen method. This will feel different, and that's okay.</p>
            
            <div style="border-left: 3px solid #3498db; padding-left: 15px; margin-top: 15px;">
                <h4>Your Personalized Instructions ({method}):</h4>
                <p><em>{method_instructions}</em></p>
            </div>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Your Task:</strong> Read the instructions above carefully. Visualize yourself doing them. Commit to following them consistently for all sleep tonight (bedtime and any night wakings). Do not give up halfway through.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The first night can be the hardest, but it's also where the most learning happens. Be patient with your baby, and be kind to yourself.</p>
        
        <p>Tomorrow, we'll talk about how to handle the inevitable challenges and troubleshoot any issues.</p>
        
        <p>You are strong. You are capable. You've got this.</p>
