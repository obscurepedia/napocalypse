    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hey there! 👋</p>
        
        <p>By now, you might have started sleep training, or you're about to. Either way, let's talk about the challenges that almost EVERY parent faces – and more importantly, how to handle them.</p>
        
        <p>Here's the truth: <strong>sleep training rarely goes perfectly</strong>. But that doesn't mean it's not working! Let's troubleshoot the most common issues.</p>
        
        <h2>🔥 The Top 7 Challenges (And How to Fix Them)</h2>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <h3>Challenge #1: "My baby cried for 2 hours straight!"</h3>
            <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> This is most common on nights 1-3. your baby is protesting the change because they're used to falling asleep a different way.</p>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>✅ Solution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stay consistent – don't switch methods mid-night</li>
                    <li>Follow your check-in schedule exactly as planned</li>
                    <li>Remember: crying peaks on night 2-3, then improves dramatically</li>
                    <li>If using graduated extinction, extend your check-in intervals gradually</li>
                    <li>Make sure your baby isn't hungry, sick, or uncomfortable</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <h3>Challenge #2: "It worked for 2 nights, then got worse!"</h3>
            <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> This is called an "extinction burst" – it's actually a sign the method is working! your baby is trying harder to get the old response.</p>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>✅ Solution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>DO NOT give in – this is the critical moment</li>
                    <li>Stay consistent with your approach</li>
                    <li>This typically lasts 1-2 nights, then improves significantly</li>
                    <li>Remind yourself: this is progress, not regression</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <h3>Challenge #3: "My baby stands up in the crib and won't lie down"</h3>
            <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> Your baby has learned to stand but hasn't mastered lying back down, or they're using standing as a protest.</p>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>✅ Solution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>For the first few times, gently lay them back down</li>
                    <li>After 2-3 times, let them figure it out (they will!)</li>
                    <li>Practice standing and sitting during the day</li>
                    <li>Stay calm and boring during check-ins</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <h3>Challenge #4: "My partner wants to give up"</h3>
            <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> It's heartbreaking to hear your baby cry. One parent often wants to quit before seeing results.</p>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>✅ Solution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have the more committed parent handle bedtime for the first week</li>
                    <li>Review the research together – remind yourselves WHY you're doing this</li>
                    <li>Set a specific timeline: "Let's commit to 5 nights, then reassess"</li>
                    <li>Track progress together so you can see improvement</li>
                    <li>Remember: short-term discomfort for long-term wellbeing</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <h3>Challenge #5: "My baby wakes up at 4am and won't go back to sleep"</h3>
            <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> Early morning wakings are the last thing to improve. Your baby's circadian rhythm needs adjustment.</p>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>✅ Solution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't start the day before 6am – treat it like a night waking</li>
                    <li>Make sure bedtime isn't too early (should be 7-8pm)</li>
                    <li>Ensure the room stays dark until wake-up time</li>
                    <li>This typically improves after 1-2 weeks of consistency</li>
                    <li>Consider using a toddler clock for older babies</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <h3>Challenge #6: "Naps are still a disaster"</h3>
            <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> Naps are harder than nighttime sleep. They require stronger sleep pressure and better timing.</p>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>✅ Solution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus on nighttime first – naps will follow</li>
                    <li>Watch wake windows carefully (don't let baby get overtired)</li>
                    <li>Use the same method for naps as nighttime</li>
                    <li>If nap is a complete failure after 30-45 min, end it and adjust next wake window</li>
                    <li>Naps typically take 1-2 weeks longer than nighttime to improve</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="challenge-box">
            <h3>Challenge #7: "I feel like a terrible parent"</h3>
            <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> Mom guilt (or dad guilt!) is real. You're questioning if you're doing the right thing.</p>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>✅ Solution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remember: sleep is a biological need, not a luxury</li>
                    <li>Research shows sleep training doesn't harm attachment</li>
                    <li>A well-rested baby is a healthier, happier baby</li>
                    <li>A well-rested parent is a better parent</li>
                    <li>You're teaching your baby a crucial life skill</li>
                    <li>Trust your instincts – if something feels wrong, pause and reassess</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>🎯 When to Pause or Stop</h2>
        <p>Sleep training isn't right for every situation. Consider pausing if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your baby is sick or teething badly</li>
            <li>You're in the middle of a major life change (moving, new sibling, etc.)</li>
            <li>Your baby is showing signs of distress beyond normal protest crying</li>
            <li>You're not mentally or emotionally ready</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's okay to pause and try again in a few weeks. This isn't a race!</p>
        
        <h2>📊 Progress Markers</h2>
        <p>You're making progress if you see ANY of these signs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Crying duration is decreasing (even by 10-15 minutes)</li>
            <li>Baby falls asleep faster than night 1</li>
            <li>Fewer night wakings (even if they're still happening)</li>
            <li>Baby seems happier during the day</li>
            <li>You're feeling more confident in your approach</li>
        </ul>
