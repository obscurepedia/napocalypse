        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>You've worked so hard to create a great sleep foundation. But life is unpredictable. Travel, sickness, holidays, and visitors can all throw a wrench in your carefully laid plans. The goal isn't to avoid disruptions, but to have a plan for them.</p>

        <p>A few off-nights will not erase all your progress. The key is to get back on track as soon as possible.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Goal for Today: The "Back-on-Track" Plan</h3>
            <p>Your task today is to have a simple mantra for when things go off the rails.</p>
            
            <h4>Rule #1: Control What You Can</h4>
            <p><strong>When Traveling:</strong> You can't replicate your baby's room, but you can bring their sleep sack, sound machine, and a portable blackout blind. A familiar smell and environment can make a huge difference.</p>

            <h4>Rule #2: Bend, Don't Break</h4>
            <p><strong>When Sick:</strong> A sick baby needs extra cuddles and comfort. It's okay to offer more support. You might hold them or rock them to sleep. The goal is to help them feel better. Just be aware that you may need to do a mini-reset once they are healthy again.</p>

            <h4>Rule #3: Get Back to Basics Immediately</h4>
            <p><strong>The Task:</strong> As soon as the disruption is over (you're home from a trip, your baby is fever-free for 24 hours), go right back to your core routine. Don't delay. Start again that very night with your {method} approach. It may take a night or two of protest, but your baby will remember the rules, and you'll be back on track faster than you think.</p>
        </div>

        <p>You've given your baby a skill for life. A few off-nights won't change that. Your confidence and consistency are the anchors.</p>
        
        <p>Tomorrow is our final day! We'll celebrate your success and talk about what comes next.</p>
        
        <p>You are so close!</p>
        
        <p>Best,<br>
