        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>Welcome to the Napocalypse 14-Day Sleep Coaching Program! I'm so glad you're here. Over the next two weeks, I'll be sending you one simple, actionable email every day to guide you and your little one toward better sleep.</p>

        <p>Forget overwhelming guides. We're going to do this one small step at a time. You've already taken the biggest step by committing to this change.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Goal for Today: The 1% Improvement</h3>
            <p>We're not aiming for perfection today. Your only goal is to observe.</p>
            <p><strong>Your Task:</strong> Tonight, before you put your baby to bed, take 5 minutes to write down the current bedtime routine. What time does it start? What are the exact steps? Don't judge it, just observe it. This is our starting point.</p>
        </div>

        <p>That's it! You've already started.</p>
        
        <p>Tomorrow, we'll talk about creating the perfect sleep environment.</p>
        
        <p>You've got this!</p>
        
        <p>Best,<br>
        The Napocalypse Team</p>
