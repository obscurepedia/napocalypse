        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>Welcome to Week 2! You've built a solid foundation for night sleep. Now, let's zoom in on the daytime challenge: naps.</p>

        <p>Nap training is often harder than night training because the drive to sleep is lower during the day. The key is consistency and managing wake windows like a hawk.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Goal for Today: The "Crib Hour"</h3>
            <p>The most common nap problem is the 30-minute "cat nap." Your baby wakes up after one sleep cycle and can't go back to sleep. Today, we'll introduce a technique to gently extend those naps.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your Task:</strong> For the first nap of the day, if your baby wakes up before the 1-hour mark, leave them in the crib for 10-15 minutes to see if they will fall back asleep on their own. This is called "crib hour."</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Don't rush in the second they make a peep. Give them some space.</li>
                <li>They may fuss or cry a bit. That's okay. You're giving them the opportunity to practice connecting sleep cycles.</li>
                <li>If they don't fall back asleep after 10-15 minutes, that's fine. Get them up and start the next wake window.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The goal isn't to force a longer nap today, but to offer the *chance* for one. Over time, this practice can lead to consistently longer naps.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Remember, consistency with your {method} method is still the number one priority for naps.</p>
        
        <p>Tomorrow, we'll discuss how to handle regressions and setbacks without losing all your progress.</p>
        
        <p>You're doing wonderfully.</p>
        
        <p>Best,<br>
