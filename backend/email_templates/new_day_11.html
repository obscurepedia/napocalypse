        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>Today we're tackling one of the most common and persistent sleep crutches: feeding to sleep. If your baby needs a bottle or breast to fall asleep at the beginning of the night, they will likely look for it every time they wake up.</p>

        <p>The goal is to gently separate feeding from sleeping. Eating is for nutrition and comfort, but sleep is a skill your baby can learn to do on their own.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Goal for Today: Move the Feed</h3>
            <p>The key is to create a small buffer between the end of the feed and the moment your baby is placed in the crib.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your Task:</strong> Tonight, move the bedtime feed to be the *first* step in your bedtime routine, not the last. </p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Feed:</strong> Give your baby their full feed in a well-lit room (like the living room). Keep them awake!</li>
                <li><strong>Routine:</strong> Proceed with the rest of your calming bedtime routine (e.g., bath, PJs, story).</li>
                <li><strong>Bed:</strong> Place your baby in the crib awake, using your {method} approach.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This small change is a huge mental shift. It breaks the association that "food = sleep." Be prepared for some protest, as this is a big change to their routine, but hold firm. Your baby is capable of falling asleep without it.</p>

        <p>If you're concerned about night feeds for nutrition, that's a separate issue we'll address tomorrow.</p>
        
        <p>You are teaching your baby invaluable skills.</p>
