        <h1>⭐ Day 4: Jessica's Gentle Method Success Story</h1>
        <p>Gradually Shifting Wake Time (Just Like You!)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hi {customer_name}! 👋</p>
        
        <p>You're on day 4 of the gentle method - and I want to share Jessica's story. She was in your exact situation: using the <strong>Gentle/No-Cry approach to fix early morning wakes</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>📖 Jessica's Story: Gradually Shifting from 5:30am to 7am</h3>
            
            <p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
            <p>Jessica's 8-month-old son, Liam, was waking at 5:30am every morning. Wide awake, ready to start the day. Jessica was exhausted and needed her mornings back, but she didn't want to use cry-it-out.</p>
            
            <p>"I wanted a gentler way to shift his wake time," Jessica said.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Approach:</strong></p>
            <p>Week 1: When Liam woke at 5:30am, Jessica would go in and try to soothe him back to sleep with patting and shushing. She kept the room dark and boring.</p>
            
            <p>Days 1-3: Liam would sometimes go back to sleep for 20-30 minutes. Small progress!</p>
            
            <p>Days 4-7: Jessica started delaying her response by 5 minutes, giving Liam a chance to resettle on his own. His wake time gradually shifted to 5:45am.</p>
            
            <p>Week 2: Jessica continued the same approach, gradually increasing the delay before going in. She also adjusted bedtime 15 minutes later.</p>
            
            <p>Days 8-14: Liam's wake time shifted to 6:00-6:15am. He was learning to resettle himself in the early morning.</p>
            
            <p>Week 3: Jessica increased the delay to 10-15 minutes. She'd only go in if Liam was truly upset (not just fussing).</p>
            
            <p>Days 15-21: Liam's wake time shifted to 6:30-6:45am. Most mornings, he'd resettle himself.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Result:</strong></p>
            <p>By week 4, Liam was consistently sleeping until 6:45-7:15am. Jessica got her mornings back. The whole process felt gentle and respectful.</p>
            
            <p>"It took a month, but I felt good about every step," Jessica said. "No crying it out, just gradual learning."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>💡 What Jessica's Story Teaches Us</h2>
        
        <p><strong>1. Early morning wakes can be shifted gradually.</strong> Expect 3-4 weeks, not 3-4 days.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Small delays add up.</strong> Starting with 5 minutes, then 10, then 15 - it works!</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Bedtime adjustments help.</strong> Moving bedtime 15-30 minutes later can help shift wake time.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4. Babies can learn to resettle.</strong> Liam learned that 5:30am wasn't wake time.</p>
        
        <h2>🎯 Your Action Plan for This Week</h2>
        
        <p>Based on Jessica's experience, here's what to focus on:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Set your goal wake time</strong> - Choose 6:30am or 7am as your target</li>
            <li><strong>When baby wakes early, wait 5 minutes</strong> - Give them a chance to resettle</li>
            <li><strong>If they don't resettle, soothe gently</strong> - Patting, shushing, keep it dark and boring</li>
            <li><strong>Gradually increase the delay</strong> - Add 5 minutes each week</li>
            <li><strong>Track the gradual shift</strong> - You should see wake time move 15-30 minutes later each week</li>
        </ol>
