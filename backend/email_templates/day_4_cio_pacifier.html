        <h1>⭐ Day 4: Emma's CIO Success Story</h1>
        <p>Breaking the Pacifier Dependency (Just Like You!)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hi {customer_name}! 👋</p>
        
        <p>You're on night 4 - and I have some good news: this is usually when things start clicking.</p>
        
        <p>Today, I want to share Emma's story. She was in your exact situation: using <strong>Cry-It-Out to break the pacifier dependency</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>📖 Emma's Story: From Pacifier Reinsertion Every Hour to Sleeping Through</h3>
            
            <p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
            <p>Emma's 8-month-old daughter, Lily, was completely dependent on her pacifier. She'd fall asleep with it, but the moment it fell out (which happened every 45-60 minutes), she'd wake up crying.</p>
            
            <p>Emma was going into Lily's room 6-8 times per night just to pop the pacifier back in. She was exhausted and resentful of that little piece of silicone.</p>
            
            <p>"I felt like a human pacifier dispenser," Emma said. "I couldn't take it anymore."</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong></p>
            <p>Night 1: Lily cried for 55 minutes at bedtime. Emma kept reaching for the pacifier out of habit.</p>
            <p>Night 2: 45 minutes of crying. Lily woke up 7 times looking for the pacifier.</p>
            <p>Night 3: 35 minutes of crying. Emma almost gave in at 2am when Lily was inconsolable.</p>
            
            <p>"I questioned everything," Emma told me. "Was I being cruel? Should I just give her the pacifier?"</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Turning Point:</strong></p>
            <p>Night 4: Lily cried for only 18 minutes at bedtime. Then slept for 6 hours straight - no pacifier needed.</p>
            
            <p>Night 5: 12 minutes of fussing. Slept 8 hours straight.</p>
            
            <p>Night 6: Lily went down with minimal protest. Slept 10 hours straight.</p>
            
            <p>Night 7: No crying. Lily fell asleep on her own, found her thumb for comfort, and slept through the night.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Result:</strong></p>
            <p>Within 2 weeks, Lily was sleeping 11-12 hours straight without any sleep props. Emma got her evenings back and was finally getting full nights of sleep.</p>
            
            <p>"The pacifier was controlling our lives," Emma said. "I'm so glad we broke free. Lily is happier, I'm happier, and she learned to self-soothe."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>💡 What Emma's Story Teaches Us</h2>
        
        <p><strong>1. Night 3 is often the hardest.</strong> Emma almost caved. Night 4 was her breakthrough.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Babies can learn to self-soothe without props.</strong> Lily found her thumb. Your baby will find their own comfort method.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. The pacifier dependency is real.</strong> It's not just about falling asleep - it's about staying asleep without constant reinsertion.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4. Freedom is worth it.</strong> No more middle-of-the-night pacifier hunts. No more anxiety about lost pacifiers.</p>
        
        <h2>🎯 Your Action Plan for Tonight</h2>
        
        <p>Based on Emma's experience, here's what to do tonight:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Remove ALL pacifiers from the room</strong> - Out of sight, out of mind</li>
            <li><strong>Do your bedtime routine without the pacifier</strong> - Offer extra cuddles instead</li>
            <li><strong>Expect less crying than previous nights</strong> - Night 4 is usually the turning point</li>
            <li><strong>Don't give in at night wakings</strong> - This is when it's hardest, but most important</li>
            <li><strong>Trust the process</strong> - Your baby will learn to self-soothe</li>
        </ol>
