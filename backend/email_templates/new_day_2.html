        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>

        <p>Day 2. How did last night go?</p>

        <p>I know you might feel like you're not doing enough yet. You are. Yesterday you took the hardest step: you started observing instead of just reacting. That awareness is powerful.</p>

        <p>Today, we're making one small but game-changing adjustment to your {baby_age_short}'s sleep space.</p>

        <!-- Environment Content Block Based on Living Situation -->
        <div style="background-color: #E8F4F8; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
            {environment_block}
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; margin: 30px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Today's Focus: Darkness</h3>

            <p>Light is sleep's worst enemy. Even a small amount of light can suppress melatonin production (the sleep hormone) and tell your baby's brain "it's time to be awake."</p>

            <p><strong>Your task for today:</strong></p>

            <!-- IF living_situation == room_sharing -->
            <p>Since you're room sharing, go to your bedroom during the middle of the day. You'll want to create a dark zone around the crib area specifically. Close the door. Cover the windows with whatever you have on hand - towels, cardboard, aluminum foil. A room divider with blackout curtains works wonders for separating the crib zone.</p>
            <!-- ELSE -->
            <p>Go into your baby's room during the middle of the day. Close the door. Cover the windows with whatever you have on hand - towels, cardboard, aluminum foil (I'm serious). No need to buy anything yet.</p>
            <!-- ENDIF -->

            <p><strong>The test:</strong> Can you see your hand in front of your face?</p>

            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>If YES - It's not dark enough. Add another layer.</li>
                <li>If NO - Perfect. That's cave-dark, and that's what we want.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Bonus:</strong> If you don't have one already, add white noise. A fan, a white noise machine, or even a free app on an old phone works. Consistent sound blocks out household noise that can wake babies between sleep cycles.</p>

            <!-- IF living_situation == apartment -->
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Apartment bonus:</strong> White noise does double duty for you - it helps baby sleep AND covers apartment sounds from hallways, neighbors, and street traffic.</p>
            <!-- ENDIF -->
        </div>

        <p>That's it. That's your only job today. Make the room dark for all naps and bedtime tonight.</p>

        <p>You'd be surprised how many sleep problems are solved by a darker room. Sometimes the simplest fixes are the most powerful.</p>

        <p>Tomorrow, we'll build a simple bedtime routine that becomes your baby's sleep signal.</p>
