        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>

        <p>Day 2. How did last night go?</p>

        <p>I know you might feel like you're not doing enough yet. You are. Yesterday you took the hardest step: you started observing instead of just reacting. That awareness is powerful.</p>

        <p>Today, we're making one small but game-changing adjustment to your {baby_age_short}'s sleep space.</p>

        <!-- Environment Content Block Based on Living Situation -->
        <div style="background-color: #E8F4F8; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
            {environment_block}
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; margin: 30px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Today's Focus: Darkness</h3>

            <p>Light is sleep's worst enemy. Even a small amount of light can suppress melatonin production (the sleep hormone) and tell your baby's brain "it's time to be awake."</p>

            <p><strong>Your task for today (complete before tonight's bedtime):</strong></p>

            <!-- IF living_situation == room_sharing -->
            <p><strong>Step 1: Test current darkness (do this between 12-3 PM when sun is brightest)</strong></p>
            <p>Go to your bedroom with your baby. Close the door. Stand in the sleep area where the crib is located.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 2: The darkness test</strong></p>
            <p>Hold your hand 6 inches in front of your face. Can you see your fingers clearly? Can you make out shapes? If YES to either - it's not dark enough.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 3: Block the light</strong></p>
            <p>Cover windows with whatever you have on hand:</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Option 1 (Free):</strong> Aluminum foil + painter's tape (no residue on walls)</li>
                <li><strong>Option 2 (Free):</strong> Large black garbage bags taped to window frame</li>
                <li><strong>Option 3 ($15-25):</strong> Blackout curtains from Amazon/Target</li>
                <li><strong>Option 4 (Room divider):</strong> Hang a sheet or room divider with dark towels to separate the crib zone from your sleeping area</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Step 4: Re-test</strong></p>
            <p>Close the door again. Wait 30 seconds for your eyes to adjust. Hold your hand up again. Can't see it? Perfect. That's cave-dark.</p>

            <!-- ELSE -->
            <p><strong>Step 1: Test current darkness (do this between 12-3 PM when sun is brightest)</strong></p>
            <p>Go into your baby's room. Close the door. Stand where the crib is.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 2: The darkness test</strong></p>
            <p>Hold your hand 6 inches in front of your face. Can you see your fingers clearly? Can you make out shapes? If YES to either - it's not dark enough.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 3: Block the light</strong></p>
            <p>Cover windows with whatever you have on hand (you don't need to buy anything yet):</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Option 1 (Free):</strong> Aluminum foil + painter's tape (no residue on walls)</li>
                <li><strong>Option 2 (Free):</strong> Large black garbage bags taped to window frame</li>
                <li><strong>Option 3 (Budget):</strong> Cardboard boxes flattened and taped over windows</li>
                <li><strong>Option 4 ($15-25):</strong> Blackout curtains (Amazon "NICETOWN" brand works great)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Step 4: Re-test</strong></p>
            <p>Close the door again. Wait 30 seconds for your eyes to adjust. Hold your hand up again. Can't see it? Perfect. That's cave-dark.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>White noise (add this today too):</strong></p>
            <p>Set up continuous white noise at <strong>50-60 decibels</strong> (about as loud as a shower running in the next room). Options:</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Free app:</strong> Download "White Noise Baby" app (leave old phone in room)</li>
                <li><strong>Household item:</strong> Run a box fan on medium speed</li>
                <li><strong>Budget option ($25):</strong> Hatch Rest sound machine</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Place it across the room from the crib (not right next to baby's head) and run it all night.</p>

            <!-- IF living_situation == apartment -->
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Apartment bonus:</strong> White noise does double duty - it helps baby sleep AND covers apartment sounds from hallways, neighbors, and street traffic. This is your secret weapon.</p>
            <!-- ENDIF -->

        <p>That's it. That's your only job today. Make the room dark for all naps and bedtime tonight.</p>

        <p>You'd be surprised how many sleep problems are solved by a darker room. Sometimes the simplest fixes are the most powerful.</p>

        <p>Tomorrow, we'll build a simple bedtime routine that becomes your baby's sleep signal.</p>
