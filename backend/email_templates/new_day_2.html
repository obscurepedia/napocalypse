        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>Welcome to Day 2! Yesterday, you took the crucial first step of observing your current routine. Today, we'll make a small but powerful change to your baby's sleep space.</p>

        <p>A great sleep environment signals to your baby that it's time for rest. We're aiming for a space that is cool, dark, and boring!</p>

        <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Goal for Today: The Darkness Test</h3>
            <p>Light is the enemy of sleep. Even a small amount can disrupt the production of melatonin, the sleep hormone.</p>
            <p><strong>Your Task:</strong> Go into your baby's room during the day and cover the windows with whatever you have (towels, cardboard, aluminum foil - no need to buy anything yet!). Can you see your hand in front of your face? If you can, it's not dark enough. Add another layer.</p>
            <p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> If you don't have one already, consider adding a white noise machine. A constant, low hum can block out household noises. You can even use a simple fan or a white noise app on an old phone.</p>

        <p>That's your one job for today. Make the room as dark as possible for all naps and bedtime tonight.</p>
        
        <p>Tomorrow, we'll introduce the concept of a consistent bedtime routine.</p>
        
        <p>You're doing great!</p>
        
        <p>Best,<br>
