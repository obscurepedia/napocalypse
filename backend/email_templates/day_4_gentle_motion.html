        <h1>⭐ Day 4: David's Gentle Method Success Story</h1>
        <p>Breaking the Rocking Habit (Just Like You!)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hi {customer_name}! 👋</p>
        
        <p>You're on day 4 of the gentle method - and I want to share David's story. He was in your exact situation: using the <strong>Gentle/No-Cry approach to break the rocking/motion dependency</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>📖 David's Story: Gradually Reducing Rocking Over 10 Days</h3>
            
            <p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
            <p>David's 9-month-old daughter, Sophia, needed 20-30 minutes of vigorous rocking to fall asleep. Every time. His back was killing him, but he didn't want to do cry-it-out.</p>
            
            <p>"I wanted a gentler way," David said. "Even if it took longer."</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Approach:</strong></p>
            <p>Days 1-3: David rocked Sophia until she was drowsy (not asleep), then put her down. She fussed for 5-10 minutes while he patted her.</p>
            
            <p>Days 4-6: He reduced rocking time to 10 minutes, put her down more awake. Patted for 10-15 minutes.</p>
            
            <p>Days 7-9: He held her still (no rocking) for 5 minutes, then put her down. Patted for 5-10 minutes.</p>
            
            <p>Day 10: He held her for 2 minutes, put her down awake, patted for 5 minutes, then left. She fell asleep on her own.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Result:</strong></p>
            <p>By week 3, Sophia was falling asleep independently with no rocking or patting. David's back pain disappeared. The whole process felt gentle and respectful.</p>
            
            <p>"It took 3 weeks instead of 3 days," David said. "But I felt good about every step. No regrets."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>💡 What David's Story Teaches Us</h2>
        
        <p><strong>1. Gradual reduction works.</strong> You don't have to go cold turkey. Small reductions add up.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Your baby can adapt to less support.</strong> Each reduction felt hard at first, then became the new normal.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. The gentle method takes patience.</strong> But the results are just as lasting as faster methods.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4. You can feel good about the process.</strong> No guilt, no trauma, just gradual learning.</p>
        
        <h2>🎯 Your Action Plan for This Week</h2>
        
        <p>Based on David's experience, here's what to focus on:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Reduce rocking time by 5 minutes</strong> - If you're rocking for 20 minutes, try 15</li>
            <li><strong>Put baby down more awake</strong> - Drowsy is okay, but not fully asleep</li>
            <li><strong>Use patting/shushing instead of picking up</strong> - Gradually reduce physical intervention</li>
            <li><strong>Be consistent with your reductions</strong> - Don't go backwards</li>
            <li><strong>Track your progress</strong> - You'll see you're doing less each day</li>
        </ol>
