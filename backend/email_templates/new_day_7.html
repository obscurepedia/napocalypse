        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>You've been on this journey for a full week. It's time to pause and acknowledge how far you've come. Progress is not a straight line, especially with sleep. It's a messy path of two steps forward, one step back.</p>

        <p>Don't get discouraged if things aren't "perfect" yet. Perfect is not the goal. Progress is. Let's find it.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Goal for Today: Acknowledge Your Progress</h3>
            <p>It's easy to focus on what's still not working. Today, I want you to actively look for the small improvements. Did any of these happen?</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Did your baby fall asleep even 5 minutes faster than before?</li>
                <li>Was there one nap where they connected a sleep cycle?</li>
                <li>Did they fuss instead of scream when you put them down?</li>
                <li>Did you get one longer stretch of sleep at night?</li>
                <li>Did YOU feel even 1% more confident?</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Your Task:</strong> Grab a piece of paper and write down **one positive change** you've noticed since Day 1. Just one. Stick it on your fridge. This is your proof that what you are doing is working.</p>
        </div>

        <p>These small wins are the foundation of lasting change. You are building a healthier sleep foundation, one night at a time.</p>
        
        <p>Tomorrow, we'll tackle the tricky world of nap transitions and how to handle them.</p>
        
        <p>Keep going. You're closer than you think.</p>
        
        <p>Best,<br>
        The Napocalypse Team</p>
