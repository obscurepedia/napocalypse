        <h1>⭐ Day 4: Amy's Gentle Method Success Story</h1>
        <p>Gentle Pacifier Weaning (Just Like You!)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hi {customer_name}! 👋</p>
        
        <p>You're on day 4 of the gentle method - and I want to share Amy's story. She was in your exact situation: using the <strong>Gentle/No-Cry approach to wean from the pacifier</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="story-box">
            <h3>📖 Amy's Story: Gentle Pacifier Weaning Over 2 Weeks</h3>
            
            <p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
            <p>Amy's 10-month-old son, Noah, was waking 5-6 times per night when his pacifier fell out. Amy was exhausted from constant pacifier reinsertion, but she didn't want to take it away cold turkey.</p>
            
            <p>"I wanted to wean gently," Amy said. "The pacifier had been his comfort for so long."</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Approach:</strong></p>
            <p>Week 1: Amy started only giving the pacifier for sleep times (not during the day). At bedtime, she'd give it to Noah, but when it fell out, she wouldn't replace it.</p>
            
            <p>Days 1-3: Noah woke up looking for it. Amy would pat and shush him instead of replacing it. He'd fuss for 10-15 minutes, then fall back asleep.</p>
            
            <p>Days 4-7: Amy started removing the pacifier once Noah was drowsy (before he fell fully asleep). He'd fuss briefly but learned to fall asleep without it in his mouth.</p>
            
            <p>Week 2: Amy stopped offering the pacifier at bedtime. She'd hold Noah, then put him down with patting and shushing. No pacifier at all.</p>
            
            <p>Days 8-10: Noah protested for 15-20 minutes but accepted the new routine.</p>
            
            <p>Days 11-14: Protests reduced to 5-10 minutes. Noah found his thumb for comfort.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Result:</strong></p>
            <p>By week 3, Noah was sleeping through the night without any pacifier. He'd self-soothe with his thumb when needed. Amy was finally getting full nights of sleep.</p>
            
            <p>"It took 2 weeks, but it felt gentle and respectful," Amy said. "Noah adapted at his own pace, and now we're both sleeping better."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>💡 What Amy's Story Teaches Us</h2>
        
        <p><strong>1. Gradual weaning works.</strong> You don't have to take the pacifier away all at once.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Babies can find alternative comfort.</strong> Noah found his thumb. Your baby will find their own way.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. The gentle method takes 2-3 weeks.</strong> But it feels better than cold turkey for many families.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4. Night wakings improve dramatically.</strong> Once the pacifier dependency is broken, sleep improves significantly.</p>
        
        <h2>🎯 Your Action Plan for This Week</h2>
        
        <p>Based on Amy's experience, here's what to focus on:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Limit pacifier to sleep times only</strong> - Remove it during awake time</li>
            <li><strong>Don't replace it when it falls out</strong> - Use patting/shushing instead</li>
            <li><strong>Remove it once baby is drowsy</strong> - Before they're fully asleep</li>
            <li><strong>Gradually reduce reliance</strong> - Each week, use it less</li>
            <li><strong>Be patient and consistent</strong> - This takes 2-3 weeks</li>
        </ol>
