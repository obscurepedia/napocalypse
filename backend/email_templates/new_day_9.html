        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>Just when you think you have it all figured out, it happens: a sleep regression. Your baby, who was sleeping beautifully, suddenly starts waking up all night again. It's frustrating, but it's also normal and temporary.</p>

        <p>Regressions often happen around developmental milestones (learning to crawl, stand, talk) or during teething or illness. The key is not to panic and not to revert to old habits.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Goal for Today: Hold the Line</h3>
            <p>When a regression hits, it's tempting to go back to rocking, feeding, or holding your baby to sleep "just for a few nights." This is the biggest mistake you can make, as it undoes all the hard work you've both put in.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your Task:</strong> If you're in the middle of a regression (or when one hits in the future), your job is to change *nothing*. </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stick to your {method} method.</strong> Consistency is your anchor in a storm.</li>
                <li><strong>Offer extra comfort during the day.</strong> If your baby is teething or frustrated with a new skill, give them lots of cuddles and attention during their wake windows.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't create new habits.</strong> Acknowledge their discomfort, offer a quick cuddle if that's part of your plan, but then put them back down awake.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think of it as a test. Your baby is checking to see if the new rules still apply. Your job is to lovingly and consistently show them that they do.</p>

        <p>This too shall pass. Your consistency will ensure it passes quickly.</p>
        
        <p>Tomorrow, we'll talk about a common challenge: dropping the pacifier.</p>
        
        <p>Stay strong. You're the expert on your baby.</p>
