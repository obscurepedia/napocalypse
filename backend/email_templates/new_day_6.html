        <p>Hi {customer_name},</p>
        
        <p>You made it through the first night! Whether it was smooth or rocky, you should be incredibly proud. The first step is always the hardest. Today is about staying consistent and navigating the common bumps in the road.</p>

        <p>It's normal for things to feel a little chaotic for the first 2-3 days. Don't mistake a few tears (or a lot of them) for failure. It's your baby learning a new skill.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Goal for Today: Be a Detective</h3>
            <p>Today, your job is to stay consistent with the {method} method for all sleep, and to identify any specific challenges that pop up.</p>
            
            <h4>Common Challenge #1: The Crying Feels Like Forever</h4>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> It almost always feels longer than it is. Set a timer. Knowing it was 15 minutes of crying, not an hour, can make a huge difference to your own sanity. Remind yourself: you are giving your baby the gift of independent sleep.</p>

            <h4>Common Challenge #2: "But what about naps?"</h4>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Yes, use the same method for naps! Nap training can sometimes take longer than night training. For now, a "short" nap (under 45 mins) that your baby falls asleep for on their own is still a huge win. Don't rescue short naps yet.</p>

            <h4>Common Challenge #3: The Early Morning Wake-Up (4/5 AM)</h4>
            <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> This is the hardest time for sleep pressure. Treat it like any other night waking. Apply your {method} consistently. Avoid starting the day before 6:00 AM, as this can lock in the early waking.</p>

        <p>Your only task today is to stick with it. Consistency is more important than perfection.</p>
        
        <p>Tomorrow, we'll talk about celebrating small wins and looking for signs of progress.</p>
        
        <p>You are doing an amazing job.</p>
        
        <p>Best,<br>
