        <p>Hi Test Customer,</p>

        <p>Let me guess: naps are driving you absolutely bonkers.</p>

        <p>I know the frustration. Night sleep is starting to come together, but your baby takes a 30-minute cat nap and wakes up cranky. You can't plan anything because you never know if this nap will be 20 minutes or 2 hours. You're exhausted from the nap guessing game.</p>

        <p>Here's what I need you to hear: <strong>Naps are harder than night sleep. This is normal.</strong></p>

        <p>The biological drive to sleep is much weaker during the day. Your baby's brain is fighting sleep because the world is interesting and bright. It's not you. It's not your method. It's just... naps.</p>

        <p>But that doesn't mean we can't make them better.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">The 30-Minute Cat Nap Problem</h3>

            <p>This is the most common nap frustration: Your baby wakes up after exactly 30 minutes (one sleep cycle), can't connect to the next cycle, and you're left with a tired, cranky baby.</p>

            <p><strong>Why this happens:</strong> Connecting sleep cycles during the day is a separate skill from falling asleep initially. They've learned part 1 (falling asleep), but part 2 (staying asleep) takes more practice.</p>

            <p><strong>The solution:</strong> The "Crib Hour" technique</p>
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #FFF9E6; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #F39C12; margin: 30px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Task for Today: Practice "Crib Hour"</h3>

            <p>For the <strong>first nap of the day only</strong> (we're keeping it simple), use the Crib Hour technique:</p>

            <p><strong>Step 1: Put baby down for first nap using your Gentle/No-Cry method</strong></p>
            <p>Use the same approach you use at night. Consistent method = faster learning.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 2: Start your timer when baby falls asleep</strong></p>
            <p>Note the exact time they fall asleep (Example: 9:15 AM). Set a goal for a 1-hour nap minimum (so in this example, you'd aim until 10:15 AM).</p>

            <p><strong>Step 3: If baby wakes before 1 hour is up, DO NOT rush in</strong></p>
            <p>When you hear your baby wake up or cry (Example: they wake at 9:45 AM - only 30 minutes):</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Wait 10-15 minutes</strong> - Set a timer so you don't guess. This is the window where they might fall back asleep.</li>
                <li><strong>What you'll hear:</strong> Fussing, crying, babbling, or silence. All of these are okay. They're practicing.</li>
                <li><strong>What NOT to do:</strong> Don't peek in, don't make noise outside the door, don't intervene yet. Give them space to figure it out.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Step 4: Decision point at 15 minutes</strong></p>
            <p>After your 10-15 minute timer goes off:</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>If baby fell back asleep:</strong> Amazing! Let them finish the nap naturally. This is the goal.</li>
                <li><strong>If baby is still crying/fussing after 15 minutes:</strong> Go get them. The nap is over. That's okay - this is practice, not perfection.</li>
                <li><strong>If baby is quiet but awake and content:</strong> You can leave them for up to 5 more minutes to see if they drift off, but if they start escalating, go get them.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Step 5: Move on to the next wake window</strong></p>
            <p>If the nap was short, that's okay. Calculate your next nap time based on wake windows (refer back to Day 4's wake window guide).</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Important reality check:</strong> Today, this probably won't result in a longer nap. That's normal. The goal is to START offering the opportunity. Over 1-2 weeks of consistent practice, your baby will learn to connect sleep cycles during the day. You're planting seeds today.</p>
