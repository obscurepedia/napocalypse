        <p>Hi Mike and Lisa,</p>

        <p>Let me guess: naps are driving you absolutely bonkers.</p>

        <p>I know the frustration. Night sleep is starting to come together, but your baby takes a 30-minute cat nap and wakes up cranky. You can't plan anything because you never know if this nap will be 20 minutes or 2 hours. You're exhausted from the nap guessing game.</p>

        <p>Here's what I need you to hear: <strong>Naps are harder than night sleep. This is normal.</strong></p>

        <p>The biological drive to sleep is much weaker during the day. Your baby's brain is fighting sleep because the world is interesting and bright. It's not you. It's not your method. It's just... naps.</p>

        <p>But that doesn't mean we can't make them better.</p>

            <h2>Naps at 4-6 Months: What to Expect</h2>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">At this age, naps are still developing. Don't expect perfection yet.</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Typical nap schedule:</strong><br />
- 3-4 naps per day<br />
- Wake windows: 1.5-2.5 hours<br />
- Total daytime sleep: 3-4 hours</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Sample schedule:</strong><br />
- Wake: 7:00 AM<br />
- Nap 1: 8:30 AM (1.5 hour window)<br />
- Nap 2: 12:00 PM<br />
- Nap 3: 3:30 PM<br />
- (Possible Nap 4): 5:00 PM (short - just to bridge to bedtime)<br />
- Bedtime: 7:00 PM</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">What's normal:</strong><br />
- Short naps (30-45 mins) are developmentally normal at this age<br />
- Nap 1 is usually the best nap<br />
- Last nap is often a "bridge" nap (just 20-30 mins)</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Focus on:</strong><br />
- Watching wake windows carefully<br />
- Offering 4 nap opportunities<br />
- Not stressing about nap length yet</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">The truth:</strong> Nap consolidation (longer naps) often doesn't happen until 6+ months. Focus on independent falling asleep first.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">The 30-Minute Cat Nap Problem</h3>

            <p>This is the most common nap frustration: Your baby wakes up after exactly 30 minutes (one sleep cycle), can't connect to the next cycle, and you're left with a tired, cranky baby.</p>

            <p><strong>Why this happens:</strong> Connecting sleep cycles during the day is a separate skill from falling asleep initially. They've learned part 1 (falling asleep), but part 2 (staying asleep) takes more practice.</p>

            <p><strong>The solution:</strong> The "Crib Hour" technique</p>
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #FFF9E6; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #F39C12; margin: 30px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Task for Today: Practice "Crib Hour"</h3>

            <p><strong>Here's what you'll do:</strong></p>

            <p>For the first nap of the day, if your baby wakes up before the 1-hour mark, <strong>don't rush in immediately</strong>. Instead:</p>

            <ol style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>Leave them in the crib for 10-15 minutes</li>
                <li>Give them space to practice connecting sleep cycles on their own</li>
                <li>They may fuss, cry, or babble - that's okay, they're learning</li>
                <li>If they don't fall back asleep after 10-15 minutes, get them up and start the next wake window</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> The goal isn't to force a longer nap today. It's to <em>offer the opportunity</em> for one. Over time (usually 1-2 weeks), this practice teaches them to connect cycles.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Still use your Gentle method</strong> for the initial nap put-down, just like you do at night. Consistency is everything.</p>
        </div>

        <p>I know this is frustrating. I know you want results yesterday. But you're doing everything right.</p>

        <p>Tomorrow, we'll talk about how to handle sleep regressions and setbacks without losing all your hard-earned progress.</p>
