        <p>Hi Mike and Lisa,</p>

        <p>You made it.</p>

        <p>Fourteen days ago, you were exhausted, uncertain, and maybe wondering if better sleep was even possible for your family. And now look at you.</p>

        <p>I know these two weeks weren't easy. I know there were nights you wanted to give up. I know there were moments you questioned whether you were doing the right thing.</p>

        <p>But you kept going. And that's everything.</p>

        <!-- Challenge-Specific Celebration -->
        <div style="background-color: #E8F9F1; padding: 25px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #27ae60; margin: 30px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #27ae60;">What You've Accomplished</h3>

            <p>In just 14 days, you:</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>Created a sleep environment that actually works</li>
                <li>Built a bedtime routine your child can count on</li>
                <li>Mastered wake windows (no more overtired meltdowns)</li>
                <li>Taught your baby the life-changing skill of independent sleep</li>
                <li>Navigated naps, night wakings, and all the curveballs</li>
                <li>Stayed consistent even when it was hard</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>From Every 1-2 Hours to Sleeping Through</h2>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">Let me remind you where you started:</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">Fourteen days ago, you were waking every 1-2 hours. That's not tired - that's survival mode. That's barely-functioning, questioning-everything, wondering-if-you'd-ever-sleep-again exhaustion.</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">And now look at you.</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">What you overcame:</strong><br />
- Chronic sleep deprivation<br />
- A baby conditioned to wake constantly<br />
- Feeding/soothing habits that reinforced the waking<br />
- Doubt that things could ever change</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">What you achieved:</strong><br />
- Long stretches of sleep (for both of you)<br />
- A baby who can sleep independently<br />
- Your own sleep cycles restored<br />
- Actual rest</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">The magnitude of this:</strong><br />
Going from 6+ wake-ups to sleeping through isn't incremental improvement. It's a complete transformation. You rewrote your baby's entire sleep pattern.</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">You're not just a little less tired. You're a different version of yourself - one who can think clearly, be present, and actually function.</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">That's huge. You did that.</p>


            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Most importantly:</strong> You gave yourself permission to prioritize your family's wellbeing. That takes courage.</p>
        </div>

        <p>I want you to take a moment - right now - and acknowledge how far you've come. Not just in sleep training, but as a parent.</p>

        <p>You trusted yourself. You learned new skills. You pushed through doubt. You showed up for your child and for yourself, night after night.</p>

        <p><strong>That's not just good parenting. That's exceptional parenting.</strong></p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">What Happens Next?</h3>

            <h2>What's Ahead: Your Baby's Sleep Future</h2>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">At 4-12 months, here's what you can expect in the coming months:</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Upcoming transitions:</strong><br />
- <strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Nap transitions</strong>: 4 to 3 naps (around 5-6 months), 3 to 2 naps (around 7-8 months)<br />
- <strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Sleep regressions</strong>: 8-10 months (separation anxiety), 12 months (developmental)<br />
- <strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Wake window changes</strong>: They'll stretch as your baby gets older<br />
- <strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Night weaning</strong>: When your pediatrician gives the green light</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">How to handle what's coming:</strong><br />
- Same approach: consistency wins<br />
- Regressions are temporary - hold the line<br />
- Adjust wake windows gradually as baby grows<br />
- Trust the foundation you've built</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">What to watch for:</strong><br />
- Signs of nap transition (fighting a nap, longer wake windows)<br />
- Separation anxiety peak (8-10 months)<br />
- Standing in crib (they'll do this - lay down once, then leave)</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Your advantage:</strong><br />
- Independent sleep skills are established<br />
- You know your method works<br />
- Your baby has the foundation for all future sleep</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">The skill you've taught your baby will serve them through every regression, transition, and phase. You've set them up for success.</p>


            <p>Here's what I want you to remember when things get rocky (because they will):</p>

            <ol style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>You've already proven you can do this.</strong> Whatever challenge comes next, you have the skills to work through it.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency is your superpower.</strong> When in doubt, go back to the fundamentals: wake windows, routine, environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Rough nights don't erase progress.</strong> One bad night (or even a bad week) doesn't mean you're back at square one.</li>
                <li><strong>You're not alone.</strong> If you ever need support, I'm here. Just reply to this email.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>The 14-day sequence is complete, but your inbox access to me isn't going anywhere. Seriously. If you hit a roadblock six months from now, reply to any of these emails. I read them.</p>

        <p>I'm so proud of you. Not just for finishing the program, but for everything you did to get here.</p>

        <p>(And I really hope you're getting at least one full sleep cycle tonight. You've earned it.)</p>

                <strong>You made it! Reply and tell me:</strong> What changed for your family? I genuinely want to know - your story matters, and I celebrate every win with the parents I work with.
