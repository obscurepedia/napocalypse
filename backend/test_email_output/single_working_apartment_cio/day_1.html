        <p>Hi Sarah,</p>

        <p>First, let me say this: I see you.</p>

        <p>I know you're exhausted. waking every 1-2 hours with your 7-12 month old - that's not just tired, that's survival mode. I know you've tried "everything" and nothing has worked. I know you're wondering if you're doing something wrong.</p>

        <p>You're not.</p>

        <!-- Parenting Setup Context -->
        <p>And since you're doing nights alone, I want you to know: this program is designed to be manageable for one person. You don't need backup at 3 AM. You can absolutely do this.</p>

        

        <!-- Work Schedule Context -->
        <p>I know you need results before Monday. You can't function at work like this. Good news: most parents see real improvement within 5-7 nights.</p>

        

        <p>Here's the good news: Better sleep is absolutely possible. And over the next 14 days, I'm going to walk you through exactly how to get there. One simple step at a time.</p>

        <!-- Age-Specific Content Block -->
        <div style="background-color: #E8F4F8; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h2>At 7-12 Months: You've Got This</h2>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">Your baby is developmentally ready for this. At this age, they're capable of sleeping long stretches, their stomach can hold enough food to get through the night, and they're smart enough to learn new patterns quickly.</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">What this means for you:</strong><br />
- Results often come within 3-5 nights<br />
- Your baby may protest more vocally (they're opinionated now!)<br />
- Separation anxiety might be peaking - this is normal<br />
- Night feeds are likely habit, not hunger</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">Your baby's ready. Now it's about giving them the chance to show you what they can do.</p>

        </div>

        <p>I'm not going to overwhelm you with a 50-page manual to read tonight. We're going to do this together, one small step at a time.</p>

        <p>You've already taken the biggest step: you decided things can be different. Everything else builds from here.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; margin: 30px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Task for Today: Just Observe</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">We're not changing anything yet. Your only goal today is awareness.</p>

            <p><strong>Tonight, before bedtime:</strong></p>
            <p>Take 5 minutes to write down your current bedtime routine. What time does it start? What are the exact steps?</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Don't judge it, just observe it.</strong> This is our starting point.</p>
        </div>

        <p>That's it. You've already started.</p>

        <p>Tomorrow, we'll talk about creating the perfect sleep environment.</p>

        <p>(And yes, you can still drink coffee - I'm not a monster)</p>
