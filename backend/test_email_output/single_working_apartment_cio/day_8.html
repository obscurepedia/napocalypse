        <p>Hi Sarah,</p>

        <p>Let me guess: naps are driving you absolutely bonkers.</p>

        <p>I know the frustration. Night sleep is starting to come together, but your baby takes a 30-minute cat nap and wakes up cranky. You can't plan anything because you never know if this nap will be 20 minutes or 2 hours. You're exhausted from the nap guessing game.</p>

        <p>Here's what I need you to hear: <strong>Naps are harder than night sleep. This is normal.</strong></p>

        <p>The biological drive to sleep is much weaker during the day. Your baby's brain is fighting sleep because the world is interesting and bright. It's not you. It's not your method. It's just... naps.</p>

        <p>But that doesn't mean we can't make them better.</p>

            <h2>Naps at 7-12 Months: Finding Your Rhythm</h2>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">This is when naps start to consolidate and get more predictable.</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Typical nap schedule:</strong><br />
- 2 naps per day (sometimes 3 for younger babies in this range)<br />
- Wake windows: 2-3.5 hours<br />
- Total daytime sleep: 2.5-3.5 hours</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Sample schedule (2 naps):</strong><br />
- Wake: 7:00 AM<br />
- Nap 1: 9:30 AM (2.5 hour window)<br />
- Nap 2: 2:00 PM<br />
- Bedtime: 7:00 PM (3.5 hour last wake window)</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">The 3-to-2 nap transition (usually 7-8 months):</strong><br />
- Signs: fighting the 3rd nap, longer wake windows, bedtime getting too late<br />
- How to do it: drop the last nap, move bedtime earlier temporarily</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">What to expect:</strong><br />
- Naps should lengthen to 1-1.5 hours each<br />
- If still getting cat naps, use "crib hour" (leave them for 60 mins total)<br />
- First nap is usually the strongest</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Watch for:</strong><br />
- Wake windows matter more now<br />
- Under-tired = won't nap; over-tired = short naps<br />
- Timing is everything</p>

            <h2>Naps When You're Not Home</h2>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">If you're working, naps happen on someone else's watch. That adds a variable.</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">The key: Communication</strong></p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">Make sure your daycare provider or nanny knows:<br />
- Your baby's wake windows<br />
- That baby goes down AWAKE<br />
- No rocking, feeding, or holding to sleep<br />
- The approach you're using at home</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">The reality check:</strong><br />
- Daycares often can't do perfect nap training conditions<br />
- Multiple babies = less individualized attention<br />
- That's okay - focus on what you CAN control</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">What to prioritize:</strong><br />
- Consistency at home (nights and weekends)<br />
- Ask daycare to try putting baby down awake<br />
- Accept that daycare naps may be shorter</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">What you control:</strong><br />
- Weekends: full nap training approach<br />
- Nights: always consistent<br />
- Communication: keep provider in the loop</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">The truth:</strong><br />
- Most babies adapt to "home rules" and "daycare rules"<br />
- Night sleep usually improves even with imperfect daycare naps<br />
- Don't stress what you can't control</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;">Focus on your consistency at home. It's enough.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">The 30-Minute Cat Nap Problem</h3>

            <p>This is the most common nap frustration: Your baby wakes up after exactly 30 minutes (one sleep cycle), can't connect to the next cycle, and you're left with a tired, cranky baby.</p>

            <p><strong>Why this happens:</strong> Connecting sleep cycles during the day is a separate skill from falling asleep initially. They've learned part 1 (falling asleep), but part 2 (staying asleep) takes more practice.</p>

            <p><strong>The solution:</strong> The "Crib Hour" technique</p>
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #FFF9E6; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #F39C12; margin: 30px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Task for Today: Practice "Crib Hour"</h3>

            <p><strong>Here's what you'll do:</strong></p>

            <p>For the first nap of the day, if your baby wakes up before the 1-hour mark, <strong>don't rush in immediately</strong>. Instead:</p>

            <ol style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>Leave them in the crib for 10-15 minutes</li>
                <li>Give them space to practice connecting sleep cycles on their own</li>
                <li>They may fuss, cry, or babble - that's okay, they're learning</li>
                <li>If they don't fall back asleep after 10-15 minutes, get them up and start the next wake window</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> The goal isn't to force a longer nap today. It's to <em>offer the opportunity</em> for one. Over time (usually 1-2 weeks), this practice teaches them to connect cycles.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Still use your CIO method</strong> for the initial nap put-down, just like you do at night. Consistency is everything.</p>
