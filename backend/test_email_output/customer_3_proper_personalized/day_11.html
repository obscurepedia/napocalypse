<title>Day 11: Breaking the Feed-to-Sleep Association</title>

        <p>Hi Test Customer,</p>

        <p>I know what you're thinking: "But my baby NEEDS to eat before bed."</p>

        <p>And you're right - they do need to eat. Feeding before bed is perfectly fine.</p>

        <p>What's NOT fine is when feeding becomes the <em>only</em> way your baby can fall asleep. Because if they need a bottle or breast to fall asleep at bedtime, they'll look for it every single time they wake up at night.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #E8F4F8; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
            {feeding_not_relevant_block}
        </div>

        <p>Today, we're separating eating from sleeping. They're both important - they just can't be the same thing.</p>

        <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; margin: 30px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Why This Matters</h3>

            <p>If your baby falls asleep while feeding, their brain creates a strong association: "Food = Sleep."</p>

            <p>When they wake up between sleep cycles (which all humans do), they don't know how to fall back asleep without that same condition. So they cry for you to recreate it.</p>

            <p><strong>The solution:</strong> Create a buffer between the end of the feed and the moment they're placed in the crib.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="background-color: #FFF9E6; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #F39C12; margin: 30px 0;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50;">Your Task for Tonight: Move the Feed (3-Step Process with 20-30 Min Buffer)</h3>

            <p>Tonight, you're creating a <strong>20-30 minute buffer</strong> between the end of the feed and when baby goes into the crib. This breaks the feed-sleep association.</p>

            <p><strong>Here's your new routine with specific timing (example for 7:00 PM bedtime):</strong></p>

            <p><strong>STEP 1: FEED FIRST (6:30 PM - Start 30 minutes before target bedtime)</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Where:</strong> Well-lit room (living room, kitchen, anywhere that's NOT the sleep space)</p>

            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Full feed while keeping baby awake</p>

            <p><strong>Specific techniques to keep baby awake during feed:</strong></p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Keep lights on:</strong> Don't dim the lights or create a sleepy environment yet</li>
                <li><strong>Talk or sing:</strong> Use a normal speaking voice, not a soft lullaby voice. Say things like "You're eating so well!" or "Look at you having your dinner!"</li>
                <li><strong>Touch their hands or feet:</strong> Gently stroke their palm, tickle their feet lightly, or hold their hand</li>
                <li><strong>Pause mid-feed:</strong> If bottle feeding, pull the bottle away every few minutes for a quick break. If breastfeeding, pause to burp or switch sides.</li>
                <li><strong>Sit upright:</strong> Don't cradle them in a sleepy position. Sit them more upright on your lap.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>If they start dozing during feed:</strong> Gently wake them with the techniques above. It's okay if they're drowsy - just not fully asleep.</p>

            <p><strong>STEP 2: CALMING ACTIVITIES (6:45-6:55 PM - This is your 20-30 minute buffer)</strong></p>

            <p>After the feed ends, do your normal bedtime routine activities. Here's what the buffer might look like:</p>

            <div style="background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 15px 0;">
                <p style="margin: 8px 0;"><strong>Example Buffer Activities (choose 3-4 that work for you):</strong></p>
                <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 8px 0;">
                    <li><strong>Bath or wipe-down:</strong> 5-7 minutes</li>
                    <li><strong>Diaper change + PJs:</strong> 3-5 minutes</li>
                    <li><strong>Book or story:</strong> 5-7 minutes</li>
                    <li><strong>Gentle song or lullaby:</strong> 2-3 minutes</li>
                    <li><strong>Cuddle in chair (not to sleep, just calm connection):</strong> 3-5 minutes</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin: 8px 0;"><strong>Total buffer time: 20-30 minutes between end of feed and crib</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this timing matters:</strong> By the time you put baby in the crib, the feed is a memory, not the immediate thing that put them to sleep. The association is broken.</p>

            <p><strong>STEP 3: INTO CRIB (7:00 PM - Target bedtime)</strong></p>

            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Place baby in crib awake</strong> (drowsy is okay, fully asleep is not)</li>
                <li><strong>Use your Gentle approach</strong> exactly as you have been the past 10 nights</li>
                <li><strong>Expect protest:</strong> This is a BIG routine change. Baby may cry more tonight because the feed isn't the last thing. That's normal.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay consistent:</strong> Don't cave and feed them back to sleep. You're teaching a new skill - it takes a few nights.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Timeline expectations:</strong></p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Night 1-2:</strong> Expect more protest at bedtime. Baby is adjusting to the new routine order.</li>
                <li><strong>Night 3-4:</strong> Protest should decrease. Baby starts accepting that feed ≠ sleep.</li>
                <li><strong>Night 5-7:</strong> New routine feels normal. Baby falls asleep without needing the feed association.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Important:</strong> Do NOT add extra feeds or move the feed back to the end "just for tonight." Consistency is everything. Your baby is capable of this - give them the chance to prove it.</p>

        <p>You're teaching your baby that eating is for nutrition and comfort, but sleep is a skill they can do on their own.</p>

        <p>That's huge.</p>
