# Sleep at 7-12 Months

Your baby is now in the "established sleeper" phase - sleep patterns are more predictable, and their brain is ready for independent sleep. This is an excellent time to address any sleep challenges.

## What's Happening Developmentally

Between 7-12 months, your baby is making huge developmental leaps. They're developing object permanence (understanding you exist even when they can't see you), which can trigger separation anxiety. They're also becoming mobile - crawling, pulling to stand, maybe even taking first steps.

**Sleep needs at this age:**
- **Total sleep**: 12-14 hours in 24 hours
- **Nighttime sleep**: 10-12 hours (many can sleep through without feeding by 9 months)
- **Daytime naps**: 2-3 hours across 2-3 naps
- **Wake windows**: 2.5-3.5 hours between sleeps

## Your Baby's Sleep Capabilities

At this age, your baby can:
- Sleep 10-12 hours straight without feeding (if nutritionally ready)
- Self-soothe when they wake between sleep cycles
- Take longer, more restorative naps (60-120 minutes)
- Understand and anticipate their sleep routine

## Common Challenges at This Age

**Separation Anxiety (8-10 months):**
Your baby now understands you exist when you leave the room, and they want you back! This can cause bedtime protests and night wakings. Stay consistent - your baby needs to learn they're safe in their sleep space.

**New Motor Skills:**
Learning to crawl, stand, or walk can disrupt sleep. Your baby might practice these skills in their crib instead of sleeping! This is temporary (usually 1-2 weeks). Give plenty of practice time during the day.

**Nap Transitions:**
The transition from 3 naps to 2 naps typically happens between 7-9 months. Signs your baby is ready:
- Consistently refusing one nap
- Taking very short naps
- Bedtime battles (not tired enough)

## Setting Up for Success

**Optimize wake windows:**
- 7-8 months: 2.25-3 hours
- 9-10 months: 2.75-3.5 hours
- 11-12 months: 3-4 hours

**Sleep environment:**
- Pitch black room (blackout curtains)
- White noise (consistent sound)
- Cool temperature (68-72°F)
- Safe crib (no items baby could use to climb out)

**Bedtime routine:**
- Same steps, same order, every night
- 20-30 minutes total
- End with baby going into crib awake
