# Sleep at 19-24 Months

Your toddler is now a full-fledged little person with opinions, preferences, and a strong will. Sleep at this age is about maintaining boundaries, managing the single nap, and preparing for the transition to a big kid bed.

## What's Happening Developmentally

Between 19-24 months, your toddler's language is exploding, they're becoming more independent, and they're testing every boundary. They understand cause and effect, which means they know exactly how to delay bedtime!

**Sleep needs at this age:**
- **Total sleep**: 11-14 hours in 24 hours
- **Nighttime sleep**: 10-12 hours
- **Daytime nap**: 1.5-3 hours (single nap)
- **Wake windows**: 5-6 hours before nap, 4-5 hours after nap

## Your Toddler's Sleep Capabilities

At this age, your toddler can:
- Sleep 11-12 hours straight without any feeds
- Self-soothe completely independently
- Understand complex bedtime routines
- Follow multi-step instructions
- Verbally express needs (and use this to delay bedtime!)

## Common Challenges at This Age

**Bedtime Negotiations:**
Your toddler has learned that asking for things delays bedtime. "I need water!" "One more hug!" "I'm scared!" Set clear boundaries and stick to them.

**Nap Resistance:**
Some toddlers start resisting the single nap around 2 years old. Don't drop the nap too early! Most toddlers need it until age 3-4. If they resist, enforce "quiet time" in their room.

**Big Kid Bed Transition:**
Many families transition to a big kid bed between 18-24 months. Only do this if necessary (climbing out of crib). It often makes sleep worse before better.

**Nighttime Fears:**
Around 2 years old, imagination develops and nighttime fears can emerge. Validate feelings but maintain boundaries. A nightlight and comfort object can help.

## Setting Up for Success

**Optimize wake windows:**
- Before nap: 5-6 hours
- After nap: 4-5 hours
- Total awake time: 9-11 hours

**Sleep environment:**
- Dark room (blackout curtains)
- White noise (consistent sound)
- Cool temperature (68-72°F)
- Toddler-proof room (if in big kid bed)
- Comfort object (stuffed animal, blanket)

**Bedtime routine:**
- Consistent routine with clear boundaries
- 20-30 minutes total
- Include limited choices ("Which book?")
- Set clear expectations ("Two books, then lights out")
- Use visual schedule if helpful

**Boundary maintenance:**
- Be consistent with rules
- Don't negotiate at bedtime
- Follow through with consequences
- Stay calm and boring
