# Sleep at 4-6 Months

Your baby is entering the "golden window" for sleep training. Their circadian rhythm is established, they can sleep longer stretches, and they're developmentally ready to learn self-soothing skills.

## What's Happening Developmentally

Between 4-6 months, your baby's sleep patterns are maturing. The chaotic newborn sleep is behind you, and more predictable patterns are emerging. This is the ideal time to establish healthy sleep habits.

**Sleep needs at this age:**
- **Total sleep**: 12-15 hours in 24 hours
- **Nighttime sleep**: 10-12 hours (many can sleep 6-8 hour stretches)
- **Daytime naps**: 3-4 hours across 3 naps
- **Wake windows**: 1.5-2.5 hours between sleeps

## Your Baby's Sleep Capabilities

At this age, your baby can:
- Sleep 6-8 hour stretches without feeding (if nutritionally ready)
- Self-soothe when they wake between sleep cycles
- Take predictable naps at consistent times
- Distinguish between day and night

## Common Challenges at This Age

**The 4-Month Sleep Regression:**
Around 4 months, your baby's sleep cycles mature and become more adult-like. This can temporarily disrupt sleep as they adjust. This is actually a sign of healthy development!

**Feeding Confusion:**
At this age, many babies still need 1-2 night feeds, but they may also wake out of habit. Work with your pediatrician to determine if night feeds are still needed.

**Rolling Over:**
Your baby might roll onto their tummy and get "stuck." Practice rolling during the day, and know that once they can roll both ways, it's safe to let them sleep in whatever position they choose.

## Setting Up for Success

**Optimize wake windows:**
- 4 months: 1.5-2 hours
- 5 months: 2-2.25 hours
- 6 months: 2-2.5 hours

**Sleep environment:**
- Dark room (blackout curtains)
- White noise (consistent sound)
- Cool temperature (68-72°F)
- Safe sleep space (firm mattress, no loose items)

**Bedtime routine:**
- Establish consistent routine (bath, massage, book, song)
- 20-30 minutes total
- Same steps, same order, every night
- End with baby going into crib awake
