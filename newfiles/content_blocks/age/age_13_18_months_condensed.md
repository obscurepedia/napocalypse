# Sleep at 13-18 Months

Your toddler is transitioning from baby to big kid, and sleep needs are changing. This is a time of major developmental leaps, boundary testing, and the big transition from 2 naps to 1 nap.

## What's Happening Developmentally

Between 13-18 months, your toddler is becoming more independent, verbal, and opinionated. They're testing boundaries, asserting preferences, and developing a strong will. This affects sleep!

**Sleep needs at this age:**
- **Total sleep**: 11-14 hours in 24 hours
- **Nighttime sleep**: 10-12 hours
- **Daytime naps**: 2-3 hours (transitioning from 2 naps to 1)
- **Wake windows**: 4-6 hours between sleeps

## Your Toddler's Sleep Capabilities

At this age, your toddler can:
- Sleep 11-12 hours straight without feeding
- Self-soothe when they wake
- Understand and follow bedtime routine
- Communicate needs verbally (which they'll use to delay bedtime!)

## Common Challenges at This Age

**The 2-to-1 Nap Transition:**
Most toddlers drop to one nap between 15-18 months. Signs they're ready:
- Consistently refusing one nap
- Taking very short naps
- Bedtime battles (not tired enough)
- Can stay awake 5-6 hours comfortably

**Boundary Testing:**
Your toddler is learning they have power and will test limits. Bedtime becomes a negotiation: "One more book!" "I need water!" "I'm scared!" Stay consistent with boundaries.

**Separation Anxiety Returns:**
Around 15-18 months, separation anxiety can resurface. Your toddler understands you're leaving and doesn't like it. Consistent routines and responses help.

**Verbal Delays:**
Your toddler can now call for you, ask for things, and protest verbally. This is developmentally appropriate but can make sleep training harder. Stay consistent.

## Setting Up for Success

**Optimize wake windows:**
- 13-15 months (2 naps): 3-4 hours
- 15-18 months (1 nap): 5-6 hours

**Sleep environment:**
- Dark room (blackout curtains essential)
- White noise (blocks out household sounds)
- Cool temperature (68-72°F)
- Toddler-proof room (if in big kid bed)

**Bedtime routine:**
- Consistent routine with clear end point
- 20-30 minutes total
- Include choices where appropriate ("Which pajamas?")
- Set clear boundaries ("Two books, then bed")
