## Your "One Thing" for Tonight

If you change nothing else, focus on this: **Put your baby down awake.**

This is the foundational skill of independent sleep. It doesn't have to be perfect. "Drowsy but awake" is your goal. This means your baby's eyes are heavy and they are calm, but they are still aware that you are placing them in their crib.

This single act begins teaching your baby that their crib is a safe place for sleep, and they are capable of drifting off without being rocked, fed, or held to sleep.

## The 3-Step Emergency Bedtime Routine

A long, complicated routine can wait. Tonight, let's implement a simple, 15-minute ritual that will signal to your baby that sleep is coming.

1.  **Warm Wipe-Down & PJs:** Use a warm washcloth to gently wipe your baby's hands, feet, and face. The warm water is soothing. Follow immediately with a fresh diaper and pajamas.

2.  **Calm Feed:** If a feed is part of your bedtime, do it now in a dimly lit, quiet room. The goal is a full tummy, not a sleeping baby. If your baby starts to doze off, gently rouse them.

3.  **A Simple Song & Cuddle:** End with a short, consistent song or a key phrase like, "I love you, it's time for sleep." Cuddle for just 2-3 minutes, then move to the crib.

The key is predictability, not complexity.

## Build a Sleep Sanctuary (The Basics)

You don't need fancy gadgets. Focus on two things tonight:

*   **Darkness:** Make the room as dark as you possibly can. Use towels, blankets, or cardboard to cover windows if you don't have blackout blinds. You shouldn't be able to see your hand in front of your face. This boosts melatonin (the sleep hormone).

*   **Consistent Sound:** Introduce a source of white noise. This can be a fan, an air purifier, or a white noise app on an old phone. It should be continuous and about the volume of a running shower. This blocks out startling household noises.

## A Note on Crying

Your baby will likely protest these changes. This is normal. Crying is your baby's primary way of communicating "This is new, and I'm not sure about it!"

Your 14-day email course will walk you through exactly how to handle this based on the sleep training method you chose. For tonight, your goal is simply to introduce these new patterns. Stay calm, be confident, and know that you are building a foundation for a lifetime of healthy sleep.

You've got this. We'll be in your inbox tomorrow with Day 1.
