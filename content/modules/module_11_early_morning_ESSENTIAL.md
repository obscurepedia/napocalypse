# Early Morning Wake Solutions

## Understanding Early Morning Wakings

Early morning wakings (4-6am) are the LAST piece of the sleep puzzle and the hardest to fix. Lower sleep pressure, lighter sleep, and rising cortisol make it easier to wake and harder to fall back asleep.

**What Counts as Early:**
- Waking before 6:00am consistently
- Unable to fall back asleep
- Ready to start the day

**Normal Wake Time:** 6:00-7:30am

**Your Goal:** Shift wake time to 6:00am or later.

## The Gradual Wake Time Shift Method (Recommended)

This method gradually shifts baby's wake time later by 15 minutes every 3-4 days. It's gentle, sustainable, and highly effective.

### How It Works

You delay the start of the day by 15 minutes every few days, allowing baby's body clock to adjust gradually.

**Current Wake Time: 5:00am**
**Goal Wake Time: 6:30am**

### Implementation

**Days 1-3: First Shift**
- Baby wakes at 5:00am
- DON'T get baby up until 5:15am
- Keep room dark and boring
- Minimal interaction
- Start day at 5:15am

**What to Do While Waiting:**
- Leave baby in crib
- Don't turn on lights
- Don't start playing
- Can check if crying, but keep it brief
- Treat like middle of night

**Days 4-6: Second Shift**
- Baby wakes at 5:00am (or slightly later)
- DON'T get baby up until 5:30am
- Same approach
- Start day at 5:30am

**Days 7-9: Third Shift**
- Baby wakes at 5:00am (or later)
- DON'T get baby up until 5:45am
- Baby's body clock adjusting
- Start day at 5:45am

**Days 10-12: Fourth Shift**
- Baby wakes at 5:00am (or later)
- DON'T get baby up until 6:00am
- Celebrate progress!
- Start day at 6:00am

**Continue if needed:**
- Keep shifting by 15 minutes
- Until desired wake time (6:30am ideal)
- Most families stop at 6:00-6:30am

### Adjusting the Schedule

**As wake time shifts later, adjust entire schedule:**

**If wake time moves from 5:00am to 6:00am:**
- Naps shift 1 hour later
- Bedtime shifts 1 hour later
- Maintain same wake windows

**Example:**
- Old: Wake 5am, Nap 8am, Bed 5:30pm
- New: Wake 6am, Nap 9am, Bed 6:30pm

## Supporting Strategies

**Optimize Bedtime:**
- Not too early (6:30-8pm ideal)
- Not too late (overtired = early wake)
- Adjust as wake time shifts

**Cap Daytime Sleep:**
- 6-9 months: 3-3.5 hours max
- 9-12 months: 2.5-3 hours max
- 12+ months: 2-2.5 hours max

**Ensure Dark Room:**
- Blackout curtains essential
- Cover any light sources
- Tape over LED lights
- Block light from under door

**Use White Noise:**
- Continuous white noise
- Masks early morning sounds
- Helps baby stay asleep
