# Module 9: Breaking Motion/Rocking Dependency

## Understanding Motion Sleep Association

If you spend hours rocking, bouncing, or walking your baby to sleep, you have a motion sleep association. Your baby has learned they need movement to fall asleep. When they wake between sleep cycles, they need that same motion to fall back asleep.

**Common Motion Dependencies:**
- Rocking in arms
- Bouncing on yoga ball
- Walking/pacing
- Stroller rides
- Car rides
- Swing or rocker

**The Problem:** Physically exhausting, unsustainable, prevents independent sleep

**The Solution:** Gradually reduce motion until baby can sleep without it.

## The Gradual Motion Reduction Method (Recommended)

This method slowly decreases motion intensity over 7-10 days, allowing baby to adjust gradually while learning to self-soothe.

### Phase 1: Reduce Motion Intensity (Days 1-3)

**Current:** Full rocking/bouncing to sleep

**Goal:** Reduce motion by 50%

**How to Do It:**
1. Start bedtime routine as normal
2. Begin rocking/bouncing as usual
3. When baby is drowsy (heavy eyelids):
   - Slow motion by half
   - If rocking vigorously, slow to gentle sway
   - If bouncing, reduce bounce height
4. Continue reduced motion until asleep
5. Wait 5-10 minutes after asleep before stopping

**What to Expect:**
- Baby may fuss when motion slows
- May take longer to fall asleep
- Stay consistent with reduced level
- Improvement by day 3

### Phase 2: Reduce Motion Duration (Days 4-6)

**Current:** Reduced motion until asleep

**Goal:** Stop motion while baby is drowsy

**How to Do It:**
1. Start with reduced motion from Phase 1
2. When baby is very drowsy:
   - Gradually slow to almost still
   - Come to complete stop
3. Hold baby still for 2-3 minutes
4. If baby fusses:
   - Resume minimal motion for 1-2 minutes
   - Slow to stop again
5. Once calm, transfer to crib

**What to Expect:**
- More protest than Phase 1
- 10-20 minutes of fussing
- Baby learning new skill
- Progress visible

### Phase 3: Stationary Holding (Days 7-9)

**Current:** Minimal motion, transfer drowsy

**Goal:** Hold still, put down awake

**How to Do It:**
1. Complete bedtime routine
2. Hold baby WITHOUT motion
3. When drowsy, place in crib awake
4. Pat chest and shush
5. Step back but stay in room

**What to Expect:**
- This is often hardest phase
- 15-30 minutes of crying
- Baby learning independence
- Stay patient and consistent

### Phase 4: Independent Sleep (Day 10+)

**Current:** Holding still, putting down awake

**Goal:** Baby falls asleep in crib independently

**How to Do It:**
1. Complete bedtime routine
2. Place baby in crib awake
3. Pat briefly if needed
4. Leave room
5. Use check-ins if needed (based on your method)

**What to Expect:**
- 10-20 minutes to fall asleep
- Minimal fussing
- Independent sleep achieved!

## Your 10-Day Action Plan

**Days 1-3: Reduce Intensity**
- [ ] Slow motion by 50%
- [ ] Stay consistent
- [ ] Track progress
- [ ] Be patient

**Days 4-6: Reduce Duration**
- [ ] Stop motion while drowsy
- [ ] Hold still
- [ ] Transfer to crib
- [ ] Notice improvement

**Days 7-9: Stationary Holding**
- [ ] No motion at all
- [ ] Put down awake
- [ ] Stay in room
- [ ] Almost there!

**Day 10+: Independence**
- [ ] Put down awake
- [ ] Leave room
- [ ] Baby sleeps independently
- [ ] Success!

## Quick Troubleshooting

**"My baby cries harder when I reduce motion"**
- This is normal protest
- Stay consistent for 3 nights before adjusting
- Make sure baby isn't overtired
- Check environment is optimal

**"It worked for 2 nights, then got worse"**
- Extinction burst (means it's working!)
- DO NOT give in
- Stay consistent
- Improvement comes after this

**"My baby stands up and won't lie down"**
- Lay down 2-3 times
- Then let them figure it out
- They will lie down when tired
- Don't make it a game

## What to Expect

**Week 1:**
- Gradual reduction of motion
- Some protest
- Visible progress
- Stay consistent

**Week 2:**
- Independent sleep
- Minimal motion needed
- Baby self-soothing
- Success!

**Results:**
- No more hours of rocking
- Baby sleeps independently
- Your arms/back feel better
- Everyone sleeping better

**Remember:** Motion dependency is one of the most physically exhausting sleep associations. Breaking it will change your life. Stay consistent and push through the hard nights!
