# Newborn Sleep Foundations (0-3 Months)

## Understanding Newborn Sleep

Your newborn's sleep is fundamentally different from older babies. In these first 3 months, your baby is still developing their circadian rhythm (internal clock) and learning the difference between day and night. This is NOT the time for formal sleep training, but it IS the time to build healthy sleep foundations.

**Key Facts:**
- Newborns sleep 14-17 hours per day in short bursts
- Sleep cycles are 45-60 minutes (vs. 90-120 minutes for adults)
- They need to eat every 2-4 hours (including at night)
- Day/night confusion is normal and temporary

**Your Goal:** Create healthy sleep habits without formal sleep training.

## The EASY Routine (Recommended Approach)

The EASY routine helps establish predictable patterns without rigid scheduling. It stands for:

**E - Eat:** Feed your baby when they wake up
**A - Activity:** Gentle play, tummy time, or interaction
**S - Sleep:** Put baby down for nap when showing tired signs
**Y - You:** Use this time for yourself while baby sleeps

**Why This Works:**
- Separates feeding from sleeping (prevents feed-to-sleep association)
- Creates predictable pattern baby can learn
- Flexible enough for newborn needs
- Builds foundation for future sleep training

### How to Implement EASY

**Step 1: Start with Wake-Up Feed**
- When baby wakes, feed them first
- Keep lights bright, talk to baby
- Full feeding (don't let them doze off)

**Step 2: Activity Time (15-30 minutes)**
- Diaper change
- Tummy time (2-5 minutes)
- Gentle play or singing
- Watch for tired cues

**Step 3: Sleep Time**
- At first tired sign, start wind-down
- Swaddle, white noise, dark room
- Put down drowsy but awake (if possible)
- If they cry, soothe and try again

**Step 4: Your Time**
- Rest, eat, shower, or do tasks
- Don't feel guilty about this time!

**Repeat every 2-3 hours during the day**

## Creating the Ideal Sleep Environment

**Darkness:**
- Use blackout curtains or shades
- Pitch black for naps and nighttime
- Helps develop circadian rhythm

**White Noise:**
- Continuous white noise (not music)
- 50-65 decibels (shower volume)
- Masks household sounds

**Temperature:**
- 68-72°F (20-22°C)
- Dress baby in one layer more than you
- Use sleep sack (not blankets)

**Safe Sleep:**
- Back to sleep, always
- Firm mattress, fitted sheet only
- Nothing else in crib (no bumpers, toys, blankets)
- Room sharing (not bed sharing) recommended

## Your 7-Day Action Plan

**Days 1-2: Observe and Track**
- Note when baby naturally sleeps and wakes
- Identify tired cues (yawning, rubbing eyes, fussiness)
- Track feeding times
- Don't try to change anything yet

**Days 3-4: Implement EASY**
- Start with morning wake-up
- Follow E-A-S-Y pattern
- Be flexible (this is a guide, not a rule)
- Focus on feeding when awake

**Days 5-7: Refine and Adjust**
- Notice patterns emerging
- Adjust timing based on baby's cues
- Celebrate small wins
- Be patient with yourself

## Quick Troubleshooting

**"My baby won't sleep unless held"**
- Normal for newborns!
- Try putting down drowsy but awake
- If they cry, pick up and try again
- Use swaddle and white noise
- This will improve with time

**"My baby has day/night confusion"**
- Keep days bright and stimulating
- Keep nights dark and boring
- Expose to natural light during day
- This typically resolves by 6-8 weeks

**"My baby only sleeps 30 minutes"**
- Normal for newborns
- Sleep cycles are short
- Will lengthen around 3-4 months
- Focus on creating good habits now

**"I'm exhausted and overwhelmed"**
- This is the hardest phase
- Accept help when offered
- Sleep when baby sleeps (really!)
- It WILL get better

## What's Next

Around 3-4 months, your baby's sleep will mature and you can begin more structured sleep training. For now, focus on:
- Establishing EASY routine
- Creating ideal sleep environment
- Separating feeding from sleeping
- Building healthy foundations

**Remember:** You're not failing if your newborn needs help to sleep. This is normal and temporary. You're building the foundation for independent sleep in the future.
