# Established Sleeper (7-12 Months)

## Why Sleep Issues Develop at This Age

Your baby was sleeping great, then suddenly everything fell apart. Or maybe sleep has always been challenging and you're finally ready to fix it. Either way, 7-12 months is still an excellent time to establish independent sleep.

**What's Different at This Age:**
- Stronger sleep associations (habits are more ingrained)
- More determined protest (they know what they want!)
- Separation anxiety may be emerging
- Can stand/sit in crib (new challenge)
- More aware of surroundings

**Your Goal:** Break existing sleep associations and establish independent sleep.

## The Modified Ferber Method (Recommended)

This method is effective for older babies who have established sleep associations. It's structured, predictable, and shows results quickly (usually 3-5 nights).

**Why This Method:**
- Fast results (most families see improvement in 3-5 nights)
- Clear structure (you know exactly what to do)
- Proven effective for this age group
- Addresses standing/sitting in crib

### How to Implement

**Preparation:**

**Night 1: Setting the Foundation**

**Bedtime:**
1. Complete 20-30 minute routine
2. Put baby in crib awake
3. Say goodnight and leave
4. **First check: 5 minutes**
5. **Second check: 10 minutes**
6. **All subsequent checks: 12 minutes**

**Check-In Protocol:**
- Enter room calmly (30 seconds max)
- If standing, lay down ONCE
- Pat chest briefly
- Say "It's sleep time, I love you"
- Leave immediately
- Do NOT pick up

**Night Wakings:**
- Use same intervals as bedtime
- Don't feed unless it's been 6+ hours
- Keep it brief and boring if you do feed

**Expected:** 45-75 minutes of crying (hardest night)

**Night 2: Stay Strong**

**Intervals:**
- First check: 7 minutes
- Second check: 12 minutes
- Subsequent: 15 minutes

**Expected:** 30-60 minutes of crying (may be worse - extinction burst)

**Night 3: The Breakthrough**

**Intervals:**
- First check: 10 minutes
- Second check: 15 minutes
- Subsequent: 17 minutes

**Expected:** 20-40 minutes of crying (improvement!)

**Nights 4-5: Rapid Improvement**

## Handling Special Challenges

**Standing in Crib:**
- Lay baby down 2-3 times during check-ins
- After that, leave them standing
- They WILL lie down when tired enough
- Practice sitting/lying during the day

**Separation Anxiety:**
- This is developmental and temporary
- Stay consistent with method
- Extra cuddles during the day
- Don't let it derail sleep training

**Multiple Sleep Associations:**
- Address one at a time if possible
- Or tackle all at once (harder but faster)
- Stay consistent with chosen approach
