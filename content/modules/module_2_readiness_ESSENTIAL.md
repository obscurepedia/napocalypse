# Sleep Training Readiness (4-6 Months)

## Why 4-6 Months is the Sweet Spot

This is the ideal age to begin sleep training. Your baby's circadian rhythm is developed, they can go longer between feeds, and they haven't yet formed strong sleep associations. Most importantly, they're developmentally ready to learn self-soothing skills.

**What's Changed:**
- Sleep cycles have matured (90-120 minutes)
- Can sleep 6-8 hour stretches at night
- Circadian rhythm is established
- Can self-soothe (if given the opportunity)

**Your Goal:** Teach your baby to fall asleep independently and link sleep cycles.

## The Gradual Extinction Method (Recommended)

This method balances effectiveness with gentleness. You'll gradually increase the time between check-ins, allowing your baby to learn self-soothing while knowing you're nearby.

**Why This Method:**
- Proven effective (85% success rate within 7 days)
- Less crying than full extinction
- Builds baby's confidence gradually
- Easier for parents to stick with

### How to Implement

4. **Wait 3 minutes** before first check-in
5. **Check-in (30 seconds max):**
   - Enter room calmly
   - Pat chest or bottom
   - Say "It's sleep time, I love you"
   - Leave immediately (don't pick up)

- It WILL improve

**"It worked for 2 nights, then got worse"**
- This is called an "extinction burst"
- It's actually a GOOD sign (means it's working)
- DO NOT give in - this is the critical moment
- Push through - improvement comes after this

**"My baby stands up and won't lie down"**
- Lay them down 2-3 times
- After that, let them figure it out
- They will eventually lie down when tired
- Don't make it a game

**"My partner wants to give up"**
- Have more committed partner handle bedtime
- Review research together
- Set specific timeline: "Let's commit to 5 nights"
- Track progress to see improvement

**Week 1:**
- Nights 1-3: Challenging (30-60 min crying)
