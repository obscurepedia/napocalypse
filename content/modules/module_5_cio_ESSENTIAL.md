# Module 5: Cry-It-Out Implementation Guide

## Understanding Cry-It-Out (CIO)

Cry-It-Out (also called "extinction" or "full extinction") is the fastest and most effective sleep training method. You put your baby down awake and don't return until morning (or designated wake time). It sounds harsh, but research shows it's safe, effective, and doesn't harm attachment.

**Why Choose CIO:**
- Fastest results (most babies sleep through in 3-5 nights)
- Least total crying (compared to gradual methods)
- Clear and simple (no check-ins to time)
- Highly effective (90%+ success rate)

**When NOT to Use CIO:**
- Baby under 6 months
- Baby is sick or teething badly
- You're not emotionally ready
- Partner strongly opposes

## The Full Extinction Method (Recommended)

This is the classic CIO approach: put baby down awake, leave room, don't return until morning (or after 10-12 hours).

### Preparation (Critical)
