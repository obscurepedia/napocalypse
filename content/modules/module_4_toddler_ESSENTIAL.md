# Toddler Sleep Transitions (13-24 Months)

## Understanding Toddler Sleep Challenges

Toddlers are different. They can climb out of cribs, delay bedtime with requests, and have big emotions about sleep. But they can also understand simple explanations and respond to behavioral approaches.

**What's Different:**
- Can communicate needs (and use it to delay bedtime!)
- Strong-willed and determined
- FOMO (fear of missing out)
- May be transitioning to toddler bed
- Can understand rules and consequences

**Your Goal:** Establish clear boundaries while maintaining connection.

## The Toddler Clock + Behavioral Approach (Recommended)

This method combines a visual sleep cue (toddler clock) with clear boundaries and positive reinforcement. It respects your toddler's development while establishing healthy sleep habits.

**Why This Method:**
- Age-appropriate (uses toddler's understanding)
- Empowers toddler (they can "check" the clock)
- Clear boundaries (no negotiation)
- Positive reinforcement (rewards good behavior)

### What You Need

**Toddler Clock:**
- Hatch Rest (most popular)
- LittleHippo Mella
- Gro Clock
- Any clock that changes color/image

**Sticker Chart (Optional):**
- For tracking successful nights
- Toddler earns stickers
- Leads to small reward

### How to Implement

**Week 1: Introduction**

**Day 1-2: Introduce the Clock**
- Show clock during daytime
- Explain: "When clock is red, stay in bed. When green, you can get up!"
- Make it exciting, not scary
- Practice during nap time

**Day 3-4: Set Expectations**
- Set clock for CURRENT wake time (even if early)
- Explain rules clearly
- "When clock turns green, call for Mommy/Daddy"
- Praise heavily when they follow rules

**Day 5-7: Consistency**
- Same routine every night
- Same response every morning
- Praise for waiting until green
- Gentle reminder if they get up early

**Week 2: Gradual Shift**

**Goal:** Shift wake time later by 15 minutes

- Move clock time 15 minutes later
- Explain: "Clock turns green a little later now"
- Praise for waiting
- Continue every 3-4 days until desired wake time

**Bedtime Routine (Critical):**

**20-30 Minutes, Same Every Night:**
1. Bath (if part of routine)
2. Pajamas
3. Brush teeth
4. Two books (toddler chooses)
5. One song
6. Tuck in with lovey
7. Check clock together
8. Goodnight, leave room

**No Negotiations:**
- "Two books" means two books (not three)
- "One more hug" gets one hug (not five)
- Set clear limits and stick to them

## Handling Common Toddler Tactics

**"I need water!"**
- Keep water bottle in room
- "Your water is right there"
- Don't bring more water

**"I need to potty!"**
- If potty training, allow one trip
- Make it quick and boring
- Back to bed immediately
- If happening repeatedly, may be delay tactic

**"I'm scared!"**
