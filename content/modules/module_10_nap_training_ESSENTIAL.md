# Module 10: Nap Training Mastery

## Why Naps Are Different (And Harder)

Naps are significantly harder than nighttime sleep. Lower sleep pressure, environmental challenges, and FOMO (fear of missing out) make naps the last piece of the sleep puzzle to fall into place.

**Key Differences:**
- Lower sleep pressure during day
- More light and noise
- Shorter sleep cycles (30-45 min)
- Harder to link cycles
- Baby doesn't want to miss out

**Your Goal:** Establish consistent, restorative naps.

## The Wake Window Method (Recommended)

Wake windows are THE KEY to successful naps. They're more important than sleep cues, clock times, or any other factor. Get the timing right, and naps become much easier.

### Understanding Wake Windows

**Wake windows** = time baby can stay awake between sleep periods

**Too short:** Baby isn't tired enough
**Too long:** Baby becomes overtired and fights sleep
**Just right:** Baby falls asleep easily and naps well

### Age-Appropriate Wake Windows

**4-5 Months:**
- First: 1.5-2 hours
- Middle: 1.75-2.25 hours
- Last: 2-2.5 hours

**6-8 Months:**
- First: 2-2.5 hours
- Middle: 2.5-3 hours
- Last: 2.5-3 hours

**9-12 Months:**
- First: 2.5-3 hours
- Second: 3-3.5 hours
- Last: 3.5-4 hours

**13-18 Months:**
- To nap: 5-6 hours
- After nap: 4-5 hours

### How to Use Wake Windows

**Week 1: Track and Observe**

**Days 1-3:**
- Note when baby wakes
- Watch for tired signs
- Note when you put baby down
- Track how long to fall asleep
- Record nap duration

**Days 4-7:**
- Identify patterns
- Calculate current wake windows
- Determine if too short or too long

**Week 2: Adjust and Implement**

**If baby fights sleep 20+ minutes:**
- Wake window too short
- Extend by 15 minutes

**If baby falls asleep quickly but wakes after 30-45 min:**
- Could be too short OR too long
- Try extending by 15 minutes first

**If baby is overtired (crying, arching):**
- Wake window too long
- Shorten by 15 minutes

**If baby falls asleep in 5-10 min and naps 1-2 hours:**
- Perfect! Maintain this timing

### Nap Training Method

**Once wake windows are optimized:**

**Step 1: Establish Nap Routine (10-15 min)**
- Diaper change
- Close curtains, white noise
- Short book or song
- Sleep sack
- Into crib

**Step 2: Put Baby Down Awake**
- At end of wake window
- Drowsy okay, but eyes open
- Say "time for nap"
- Leave room

**Step 3: Use Your Sleep Training Method**
- Same method as nighttime
- Check-ins or full extinction
- Stay consistent

**Step 4: The 45-Minute Rule**
- If baby doesn't fall asleep after 45 minutes
- End nap attempt
- Adjust next wake window
- Try again next nap

## Fixing Short Naps (30-45 Minutes)

**The Wake-to-Sleep Method:**

**Days 1-3: Observe**
- Note exact time baby wakes (usually consistent)

**Days 4-7: Intervene**
- Go in 5 minutes BEFORE usual wake time
- Gently rouse baby (light touch)
- Don't fully wake
- Leave room
- Baby should resettle and sleep longer

**Why It Works:**
- Disrupts sleep cycle transition
- Helps baby learn to link cycles
- After 5-7 days, baby does it independently

## Your 14-Day Action Plan

**Days 1-7: Optimize Wake Windows**
- [ ] Track all naps
- [ ] Calculate wake windows
- [ ] Adjust by 15-minute increments
- [ ] Find optimal timing

**Days 8-10: Implement Nap Training**
- [ ] Use optimized wake windows
- [ ] Consistent nap routine
- [ ] Put down awake
- [ ] Use sleep training method

**Days 11-14: Consolidation**
- [ ] Maintain consistency
- [ ] Fine-tune timing
- [ ] Celebrate success
- [ ] Enjoy better naps!

## Quick Troubleshooting

**"My baby won't nap longer than 30 minutes"**
- Check wake windows (most common issue)
- Try wake-to-sleep method
- Ensure room is dark enough
- Give it 2-3 weeks

**"My baby fights every nap"**
- Wake windows likely off
- Track for 3-5 days
- Adjust by 15 minutes
- Stay consistent

**"Naps are great but nights are terrible"**
- Too much daytime sleep
- Cap total nap time:
  * 6-9 months: 3-3.5 hours max
  * 9-12 months: 2.5-3 hours max
  * 12+ months: 2-2.5 hours max

## What to Expect

**Week 1:**
- Figuring out timing
- Some short naps
- Trial and error
- Be patient

**Week 2:**
- Better timing
- Longer naps
- More consistency
- Progress visible

**Week 3:**
- Solid naps
- Predictable schedule
- Happy baby
- Success!

**Results:**
- 1-2 hour naps (age dependent)
- Predictable schedule
- Baby wakes happy
- You have breaks during day

**Remember:** Naps take longer to fix than nighttime (2-3 weeks vs. 5-7 days). Be patient, focus on wake windows, and stay consistent!
