# Established Sleeper (7-12 Months): Your Sleep Fix Action Plan

## Welcome to Your Sleep Solution

Your baby is 7-12 months old and still not sleeping through the night. Maybe you never sleep trained. Maybe you tried and gave up. Maybe sleep was okay and then suddenly fell apart. Whatever brought you here, you're in the right place.

Here's the good news: **It's not too late.** In fact, sleep training at this age is often EASIER than at 4-6 months. Your baby is more resilient, more adaptable, and physically capable of sleeping 11-12 hours straight.

Here's the reality check: **Your baby should be sleeping through the night.** If they're not, something needs to change. And that something is usually the schedule, the sleep associations, or your response to night wakings.

This guide will help you:
- Understand why sleep problems persist at this age
- Fix your baby's schedule
- Eliminate sleep associations
- Choose the right sleep training method
- Get results in 3-7 days

No more excuses. No more "maybe it's teething" or "maybe they're going through something." It's time to fix this. Let's get your family sleeping.

## Understanding 7-12 Month Sleep

### What's Different at This Age

Your baby's sleep needs and capabilities have changed significantly since the newborn phase:

**Sleep Requirements:**
- **Night sleep:** 11-12 hours (uninterrupted)
- **Daytime sleep:** 2-3 hours (2-3 naps)
- **Total sleep:** 12-15 hours per day
- **Can definitely sleep through the night** without feeding

**Physical Capabilities:**
- Can roll, sit, crawl, maybe pull to stand
- Can move around crib to find comfortable position
- Physically capable of self-soothing
- Strong enough to sleep 11-12 hours without feeding

**Developmental Stage:**
- **Separation anxiety** emerging (7-9 months)
- **Object permanence** developing (knows you exist when gone)
- **Increased mobility** (crawling, pulling up)
- **Testing boundaries** constantly
- **Can understand routine** and expectations

**The Bottom Line:**
Your baby is fully capable of sleeping through the night. If they're not, it's a behavioral issue, not a developmental one.

### Why Sleep Problems Persist at This Age

Let's be honest about why your baby isn't sleeping:

**Sleep Training Never Happened:**
- You survived the newborn phase hoping it would get better
- It didn't get better on its own
- Now you have a 9-month-old who still wakes every 2 hours
- The longer you wait, the harder it gets

**Sleep Associations Still in Place:**
- Baby still needs rocking, feeding, or holding to fall asleep
- Can't recreate these conditions at 2 AM
- Wakes every sleep cycle needing your help
- These associations must be eliminated

**Schedule Issues:**
- Too much daytime sleep stealing night sleep
- Wake windows not age-appropriate
- Bedtime too late (overtired)
- Bedtime too early (undertired)
- Inconsistent schedule

**New Skills Disrupting Sleep:**
- Baby practices standing in crib
- Crawling around instead of sleeping
- Excited about new abilities
- Needs to learn these skills don't happen at night

**Separation Anxiety:**
- Peaks around 8-9 months
- Baby realizes you leave when they sleep
- Tests to see if you'll come back
- Needs consistent response

**Inconsistent Parental Response:**
- Sometimes you rock, sometimes you don't
- Sometimes you feed, sometimes you don't
- Baby never knows what to expect
- Inconsistency makes sleep worse

**Excuses (Let's Be Real):**
- "Maybe it's teething" (teething doesn't last months)
- "Maybe they're hungry" (no, they're not—they're 10 months old)
- "Maybe it's a regression" (it's been 3 months—that's not a regression)
- "Maybe they need me" (they need sleep more than they need you at 2 AM)

### The Good News

Here's why sleep training at 7-12 months is actually EASIER than younger ages:

**More Resilient:**
- Can handle sleep training process better
- Less fragile than younger babies
- Bounce back faster

**Better Understanding:**
- Can understand routine and expectations
- Responds to consistency
- Learns faster

**Physically Capable:**
- Definitely can sleep 11-12 hours without feeding
- Can self-soothe effectively
- Can move to find comfortable position

**Results Come Faster:**
- Typically see improvement in 3-5 days
- Faster than younger babies
- More dramatic results

**Window Before Toddler Defiance:**
- Still young enough to be adaptable
- Before strong-willed toddler phase
- Easier now than at 15-18 months

**You Can Fix This Quickly:**
With the right approach, your baby can be sleeping through the night within a week. Let's do this.

## Step 1: Optimize the Schedule First

Before you even think about sleep training, you MUST fix the schedule. An overtired or undertired baby won't sleep well no matter what method you use.

### Age-Appropriate Wake Windows

Wake windows are the amount of time your baby can stay awake between sleep periods. Follow these carefully:

**7-8 Months:**
- Wake windows: 2-3 hours
- 3 naps per day (transitioning to 2)
- Total daytime sleep: 2.5-3.5 hours

**9-10 Months:**
- Wake windows: 2.5-3.5 hours
- 2 naps per day
- Total daytime sleep: 2.5-3 hours

**11-12 Months:**
- Wake windows: 3-4 hours
- 2 naps per day
- Total daytime sleep: 2-3 hours

**Important:** The last wake window before bedtime is often the longest.

### The 3→2 Nap Transition

Most babies transition from 3 naps to 2 naps between 7-9 months. Here's how to know if it's time:

**Signs It's Time:**
- Fighting one nap consistently (usually the third)
- Taking 30+ minutes to fall asleep at one nap
- Early morning wakings (before 6 AM)
- Bedtime battles
- Age 7-9 months

**How to Transition:**
1. Push morning nap later by 15 minutes every 3 days
2. Target: First nap around 9:30-10 AM
3. Second nap around 2-2:30 PM
4. Earlier bedtime during transition (6-6:30 PM)
5. Some days will be rough (accept this)
6. Takes 1-2 weeks to stabilize
7. Don't go back to 3 naps once committed

**During Transition:**
- Offer third nap if baby is melting down
- But cap it at 20-30 minutes
- Very early bedtime on rough days (5:30-6 PM is okay)
- Be flexible but consistent

### Sample Schedules by Age

**8-Month-Old (2 Naps):**
```
7:00 AM - Wake, feed
9:30 AM - Nap 1 (1-1.5 hours)
11:00 AM - Wake, feed
2:00 PM - Nap 2 (1-1.5 hours)
3:30 PM - Wake, feed
6:30 PM - Bedtime routine
7:00 PM - Asleep for night
```

**10-Month-Old (2 Naps):**
```
7:00 AM - Wake, feed
10:00 AM - Nap 1 (1-1.5 hours)
11:30 AM - Wake, feed
2:30 PM - Nap 2 (1-1.5 hours)
4:00 PM - Wake, feed
6:45 PM - Bedtime routine
7:15 PM - Asleep for night
```

**11-Month-Old (2 Naps):**
```
7:00 AM - Wake, feed
10:30 AM - Nap 1 (1-1.5 hours)
12:00 PM - Wake, feed
3:00 PM - Nap 2 (1 hour)
4:00 PM - Wake, feed
7:00 PM - Bedtime routine
7:30 PM - Asleep for night
```

### Critical Schedule Rules

**Rule 1: Cap Total Daytime Sleep**
- Maximum 3 hours for 7-9 months
- Maximum 2.5 hours for 10-12 months
- If baby sleeps more, night sleep suffers
- Wake baby from naps if needed

**Rule 2: No Naps After 4 PM**
- Late naps push bedtime too late
- Interferes with night sleep
- Wake baby by 4 PM if still sleeping

**Rule 3: Consistent Wake Time**
- Same time every morning (±30 minutes)
- Even on weekends
- Sets circadian rhythm
- Don't let baby sleep past 7:30 AM

**Rule 4: Appropriate Bedtime**
- 6:30-7:30 PM for this age
- Earlier is better than later
- Don't be afraid of early bedtime
- Early bedtime prevents overtiredness

**Rule 5: Watch for Overtiredness**
- Rubbing eyes
- Yawning
- Fussiness
- Decreased activity
- Red eyebrows
- If you see these, start nap routine immediately

### Schedule Troubleshooting

**Problem: Baby Fighting Bedtime**
- **Cause:** Undertired (too much daytime sleep)
- **Solution:** Cap naps, push bedtime 15 minutes later

**Problem: Crying a Lot at Bedtime**
- **Cause:** Overtired (wake windows too long)
- **Solution:** Earlier bedtime, shorter wake windows

**Problem: Early Morning Waking (Before 6 AM)**
- **Cause:** Too much daytime sleep OR bedtime too early
- **Solution:** Cap naps at 2.5 hours total, push bedtime 15 minutes later

**Problem: Short Naps (30-45 Minutes)**
- **Cause:** May be normal OR schedule issue
- **Solution:** Ensure wake windows are appropriate, work on independent sleep

**Problem: Fighting Naps**
- **Cause:** Wake windows not right OR sleep associations
- **Solution:** Adjust wake windows, apply sleep training to naps

---

## Step 2: Eliminate Sleep Associations

Sleep associations are anything your baby needs to fall asleep. If they can't recreate it themselves at 2 AM, it's a problem.

### Common Sleep Associations to Break

**Feeding to Sleep:**
- Baby falls asleep while nursing or taking bottle
- Can't fall asleep without feeding
- Wakes every 2-3 hours needing to feed back to sleep
- **Solution:** See Module 7 for detailed instructions

**Rocking to Sleep:**
- Baby falls asleep while being rocked
- Can't fall asleep in crib
- Wakes needing to be rocked back to sleep
- **Solution:** Gradual reduction or cold turkey elimination

**Holding Until Asleep:**
- Baby falls asleep in your arms
- Can't fall asleep in crib
- Wakes when put down or between sleep cycles
- **Solution:** Put down drowsy but awake, apply sleep training

**Pacifier Dependency:**
- Baby falls asleep with pacifier
- Wakes every time it falls out
- You're replacing it 5+ times per night
- **Solution:** Remove completely OR commit to replacing all night

**Co-Sleeping:**
- Baby sleeps in your bed
- Can't sleep in crib
- Wakes when not next to you
- **Solution:** See Module 8 for transition plan

**Motion (Car, Stroller, Swing):**
- Baby only sleeps with movement
- Can't sleep in stationary crib
- Wakes when movement stops
- **Solution:** Transition to crib, apply sleep training

### How to Eliminate Sleep Associations

You have two approaches:

**Approach 1: Cold Turkey (Recommended for 7-12 Months)**
- Stop the association completely starting Night 1
- Apply sleep training method to all sleep periods
- Fastest and most effective
- Results in 3-7 days
- Baby adjusts quickly

**Approach 2: Gradual Reduction**
- Slowly reduce the association over 1-2 weeks
- Example: Rock for shorter time each night
- Slower but gentler
- Takes 10-14 days
- May be harder to maintain consistency

**For 7-12 Months, Cold Turkey Usually Works Best:**
- Baby is resilient enough to handle it
- Faster results
- Less confusing for baby
- Clearer boundaries

### Replacing Sleep Associations

When you remove old associations, you need to replace them with healthy sleep cues:

**Healthy Sleep Cues:**
- Consistent bedtime routine
- White noise (this is a GOOD association)
- Sleep sack
- Dark room
- Same goodnight phrase
- Lovey (if 12+ months)

**These are different because:**
- Baby can recreate them independently
- They're present all night
- They don't require your intervention
- They support independent sleep

---

## Step 3: Choose Your Sleep Training Method

At 7-12 months, faster methods typically work better. Your baby is resilient and can handle more direct approaches.

### Recommended Methods for This Age

**Method 1: Cry-It-Out (Extinction) - Module 5**
- **Best for:** This age group, need fast results
- **Timeline:** 3-5 days
- **Approach:** Put down awake, don't return until morning
- **Why it works well:** Baby is old enough to handle it, results are fast

**Method 2: Ferber (Graduated Extinction) - Module 6**
- **Best for:** Parents who need check-ins
- **Timeline:** 5-7 days
- **Approach:** Timed check-ins (3-5-10-15 minutes)
- **Why it works well:** Middle ground, still effective

**Method 3: Chair Method - Module 6**
- **Best for:** Apartment living, very sensitive babies
- **Timeline:** 7-14 days
- **Approach:** Sit in chair, gradually move away
- **Why it works well:** Less crying, but slower

**Recommendation:**
For 7-12 months, Cry-It-Out or Ferber work best. Baby is resilient enough to handle these methods, and you'll see results faster.

### What About Gentler Methods?

**Pick-Up-Put-Down:**
- NOT recommended for this age
- Too stimulating
- Baby gets more upset
- Takes too long
- Use Chair Method instead if you want gentle

**No-Cry Methods:**
- Rarely work at this age
- Baby is too old for these to be effective
- You'll be stuck for weeks with no progress
- Choose a method with some crying

**The Reality:**
At 7-12 months, some crying is inevitable. Choose a method that minimizes crying while still being effective.

## Step 4: Night Weaning Protocol

At 7-12 months, most babies don't need night feeds. Let's eliminate them.

### Consult Your Pediatrician

Always get approval before night weaning. Discuss:
- Baby's weight gain
- Daytime intake
- Any medical concerns
- Specific recommendations for your baby

### General Guidelines

**7-9 Months:**
- Most can go 11-12 hours without feeding
- Some may need 1 feed if small or poor daytime eater
- Pediatrician will guide you

**10-12 Months:**
- Definitely no night feeds needed
- Should be eating well during day
- Night feeds are 100% habit

### Cold Turkey Night Weaning (Recommended)

This is the fastest and most effective approach for this age:

**How to Do It:**
1. Choose start date (same night as sleep training)
2. No feeds at any night wakings
3. Apply sleep training method to all wakings
4. Offer water if needed (not milk)
5. Stay consistent

**What to Expect:**
- Night 1-2: Baby will protest (they expect to be fed)
- Night 3-4: Dramatic improvement
- Night 5-7: Sleeping through or minimal wakings
- Baby adjusts quickly

**If Breastfeeding:**
- Have partner do ALL night wakings
- Baby smells milk on you and will protest more
- Mom can sleep in different room for 3-5 nights
- Pump if uncomfortable
- Reunion after night weaning complete

### Increasing Daytime Feeds

Critical: Baby needs same calories, just shifted to daytime.

**How to Increase:**
- Offer feeds every 2.5-3 hours during day
- Ensure full feeds (not snacking)
- Add extra feed if needed
- Offer more solids (but milk is still primary under 12 months)

**Sample Feeding Schedule (10 months):**
```
7:00 AM - Milk feed
8:00 AM - Breakfast (solids)
10:00 AM - Milk feed
12:00 PM - Lunch (solids)
2:00 PM - Milk feed
5:00 PM - Dinner (solids)
6:30 PM - Bedtime milk feed
NIGHT - No feeds, water only if needed
```

## Your 7-Day Sleep Fix Action Plan

Let's put it all together with a clear, day-by-day plan.

### Days 1-2: Assessment & Preparation

**Goals:**
- Identify current problems
- Fix schedule
- Eliminate sleep associations
- Choose method
- Prepare environment

**Action Steps:**
- [ ] Assess current schedule (is it age-appropriate?)
- [ ] Identify sleep associations (what needs to go?)
- [ ] Optimize sleep environment (dark, white noise, temperature)
- [ ] Choose sleep training method
- [ ] Get partner aligned
- [ ] Set up tracking sheet

**Schedule Assessment:**
- What time does baby wake?
- What are current wake windows?
- How many naps? How long?
- What time is bedtime?
- Is baby overtired or undertired?

**Sleep Association Assessment:**
- How does baby fall asleep at bedtime?
- What do you do at night wakings?
- What needs to be eliminated?

### Day 3: Preparation Day

**Goals:**
- Finalize plan
- Practice new routine
- Mental preparation

**Action Steps:**
- [ ] Implement age-appropriate schedule

## Handling 7-12 Month Specific Challenges

### Challenge 1: Baby Stands Up in Crib and Cries

**Why It Happens:**
- New skill, practicing constantly
- Doesn't know how to get back down
- Seeking attention/interaction

**Solutions:**
- **Practice sitting down during the day** (repeatedly)
- **Don't lay baby back down at night** (they need to learn)
- **Verbal coaching only:** "Sit down, lie down, go to sleep"
- **Stay consistent—don't rescue**
- **Resolves in 3-5 nights** once they learn
- **Sleep sack can slow standing** (but not prevent)

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't go in and lay them down
- Don't pick them up
- Don't engage in conversation
- Just verbal coaching from doorway

**Timeline:**
- Night 1-2: Lots of standing, crying
- Night 3-4: Starting to sit down on own
- Night 5+: Lying down independently

### Challenge 2: Separation Anxiety Causing Night Wakings

**Why It Happens:**
- Object permanence developing (7-9 months)
- Knows you exist when gone
- Testing to see if you'll come back
- Normal developmental phase

**Solutions:**
- **Practice separation during the day** (peek-a-boo, leave room briefly)
- **Consistent bedtime routine** (predictability helps)
- **Don't reinforce anxiety by rushing in**
- **Brief check-ins if using Ferber method**
- **Lovey for comfort** (if 12+ months)
- **Resolves naturally by 10-12 months**

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't start co-sleeping
- Don't bring baby to your bed
- Don't create new sleep associations
- Stay consistent

### Challenge 3: Nap Transitions Disrupting Night Sleep

**Why It Happens:**
- 3→2 nap transition (7-9 months)
- Too much daytime sleep stealing night sleep
- Wake windows not adjusted properly

**Solutions:**
- **Watch for nap transition signs** (fighting one nap, early waking)
- **Stretch wake windows gradually**
- **Cap total daytime sleep at 3 hours**
- **Earlier bedtime during transition** (6-6:30 PM)
- **Transition takes 1-2 weeks**
- **Prioritize night sleep over naps**

**During Transition:**
- Some days will be rough (accept this)
- Very early bedtime on bad nap days
- Don't go back to 3 naps once committed
- Push through the transition

### Challenge 4: Early Morning Wakings (Before 6 AM)

**Why It Happens:**
- Bedtime too early
- Too much daytime sleep
- Room not dark enough
- Habit from inconsistent response

**Solutions:**
- **Treat as night waking until 6 AM** (don't start day)
- **Blackout curtains essential**
- **Push bedtime 15 minutes later every 3 days**
- **Cap daytime sleep**
- **Consistent response** (don't get baby up)
- **Takes 7-14 days to shift**

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't start the day before 6 AM
- Don't turn on lights
- Don't feed
- Don't get baby out of crib

### Challenge 5: Teething Disrupting Sleep

**Why It Happens:**
- Pain and discomfort
- BUT: Often used as excuse when not real cause

**Solutions:**
- **Give pain relief 30 minutes before bed** (if needed)
- **Don't create new sleep associations**
- **One night of comfort, then back to normal**
- **True teething pain doesn't last weeks**
- **If "teething" for 2+ weeks, it's not teething**
- **Stay consistent with sleep training**

**The Reality:**
- Teething is often blamed for sleep issues
- But teething doesn't cause weeks of sleep problems
- Don't use it as excuse to revert to old habits
- Offer comfort without creating new associations

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### "No Improvement After 7 Days"

**Check These:**
- [ ] Is schedule age-appropriate?
- [ ] Are you being truly consistent?
- [ ] Is room dark enough?
- [ ] Are all sleep associations eliminated?
- [ ] Is baby overtired or undertired?
- [ ] Are you giving in at night?

**Solutions:**
- Reassess schedule (most common issue)
- Verify complete consistency
- Check for medical issues (reflux, allergies)
- Consider different method
- Consult pediatrician

### "Baby Getting Worse, Not Better"

**Possible Causes:**
- Extinction burst (normal on nights 2-3)
- Schedule issue (overtired or undertired)
- Illness or teething (rare but possible)
- Inconsistency (giving in sometimes)

**Solutions:**
- If extinction burst: Stay consistent, breakthrough coming
- If schedule issue: Adjust and continue
- If illness: Pause, resume when healthy
- If inconsistent: Commit to consistency

### "Works for Bedtime But Not Night Wakings"

**Why It Happens:**
- Easier to resist at bedtime (fully awake)
- Harder at 2 AM (half-asleep)
- Different skill set required

**Solutions:**
- Apply exact same method at night wakings
- Don't feed/rock/rescue at night
- Night improvements lag behind bedtime by 3-5 days
- Give it more time
- Partner does night wakings (if breastfeeding)

### "Naps Are Still Terrible"

**Why It Happens:**
- Night sleep comes first (normal)
- Naps improve 1-2 weeks after nights
- May need separate nap training

**Solutions:**
- Focus on night sleep first
- Apply same method to naps after nights improve
- Consider nap training separately if needed
- Some babies naturally take short naps (30-45 min is okay)

## Final Thoughts

You've been exhausted for months. You've tried everything. You've made excuses. You've hoped it would get better on its own.

But here's the truth: **It won't get better on its own. You have to fix it.**

The good news? You can fix it. In less than a week, your baby can be sleeping 11-12 hours straight. Your exhaustion will lift. Your patience will return. You'll feel like yourself again.

But you have to commit. No more excuses. No more "maybe it's teething." No more giving in at 3 AM because you're tired.

Your baby is capable of sleeping through the night. They're just waiting for you to teach them how.

So make the decision. Choose your method. Fix the schedule. Eliminate the sleep associations. And start tonight.

Better sleep is 3-7 days away.

You've got this.
