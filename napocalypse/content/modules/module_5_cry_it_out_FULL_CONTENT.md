# Cry-It-Out Sleep Training: Your Complete Implementation Guide

## Welcome to Your Fast-Track Sleep Solution

You've chosen the cry-it-out method, and that takes courage. This is the most direct, fastest path to independent sleep—and it works. While hearing your baby cry is hard, you're about to give your entire family the gift of better sleep in just 3-7 days.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to implement cry-it-out safely and effectively. You'll get clear, step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting for common issues, and the confidence to see this through.

Let's be clear: cry-it-out is not cruel. It's not abandonment. It's teaching your baby a valuable life skill—the ability to fall asleep independently. And the research backs this up with over 40 years of studies showing it's safe, effective, and has no long-term negative effects.

You're making a decision that will benefit your baby, your relationship with your partner, and your own mental health. Let's get started.

---

## Understanding Cry-It-Out (Extinction)

### What Is Cry-It-Out?

Cry-it-out, also called "extinction" or "full extinction," is straightforward: You put your baby in their crib awake, say goodnight, leave the room, and don't return until morning (or a predetermined wake time, typically 6 AM).

There are no check-ins. No interventions. No going back in "just to make sure they're okay." You monitor via video or audio, but you don't enter the room.

This is the fastest sleep training method available. Most babies show significant improvement within 3-5 nights, with many sleeping through the night by night 7.

### The Science Behind CIO

Let's talk about the research, because understanding the science will help you stay strong on difficult nights.

**40+ Years of Research:** Cry-it-out has been studied extensively since the 1980s. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have examined its safety and effectiveness.

**No Long-Term Harm:** A landmark Australian study followed children who underwent sleep training (including cry-it-out) and found no differences in attachment, behavior, or emotional health at age 6 compared to children who didn't sleep train.

**Highly Effective:** Research shows cry-it-out is effective in 94% of cases when implemented consistently. It's the most reliable sleep training method available.

**Cortisol Levels Normalize Quickly:** While cortisol (stress hormone) levels do rise during crying, they return to baseline within days and don't cause lasting effects.

**Benefits Entire Family:** Studies show that successful sleep training reduces parental stress, decreases postpartum depression symptoms, and improves family functioning.

**Teaching Self-Soothing:** Your baby isn't learning that you won't come when they need you. They're learning that they have the ability to fall asleep on their own—a skill they'll use for life.

### Debunking Common Myths

Let's address the fears you might have heard:

**Myth: "It damages attachment."**
**Reality:** Secure attachment is built through responsive parenting during waking hours. Teaching independent sleep at night doesn't harm the parent-child bond. The Australian study found no difference in attachment security between sleep-trained and non-sleep-trained children.

**Myth: "Baby will feel abandoned."**
**Reality:** Your baby is safe, fed, dry, and comfortable. You're nearby and monitoring. They're not being neglected—they're learning a new skill. Think of it like learning to walk: there's frustration involved, but you're not abandoning them by letting them practice.

**Myth: "It's cruel."**
**Reality:** What's cruel is chronic sleep deprivation for the entire family. Exhausted parents are less patient, less emotionally available, and at higher risk for depression. A few nights of crying leads to months and years of better sleep for everyone.

**Myth: "Baby will cry for hours every night forever."**
**Reality:** Here's the typical timeline:
- Night 1: 30-60 minutes of crying (some babies less, some more)
- Night 2-3: 20-40 minutes
- Night 4-5: 10-20 minutes
- Night 6+: 5-10 minutes or none

The crying decreases rapidly with consistency.

### Who CIO Is Perfect For

Cry-it-out is ideal if you:

- Need fast results (returning to work, severe sleep deprivation)
- Feel comfortable with crying as part of the learning process
- Have tried gentler methods without success
- Have a baby 6+ months old (4 months minimum with pediatrician approval)
- Live in a house with separate nursery (not required, but easier)
- Are fully committed to consistency
- Have your pediatrician's approval

If this describes you, you're in the right place.

## Pre-CIO Preparation: Setting Yourself Up for Success

Success with cry-it-out is 50% preparation. Before you start, you need to have everything in place.

### Essential Requirements Checklist

Go through this checklist carefully. If you can't check every box, don't start yet.

**Baby Readiness:**
- [ ] Baby is at least 6 months old (4 months minimum with pediatrician approval)
- [ ] Pediatrician has approved night weaning and sleep training
- [ ] Baby is healthy (no fever, ear infection, or illness)
- [ ] Baby weighs at least 12-14 pounds
- [ ] No major developmental leaps happening right now

**Environment Readiness:**
- [ ] Room is pitch black (blackout curtains installed)
- [ ] White noise machine running continuously (not on timer)
- [ ] Room temperature is 68-72°F
- [ ] Crib meets current safety standards
- [ ] Video monitor set up and working
- [ ] Sleep sack ready (no loose blankets)

**Schedule Readiness:**
- [ ] Consistent wake time established (±30 minutes)
- [ ] Age-appropriate wake windows being followed
- [ ] Bedtime routine perfected (20-30 minutes, same every night)
- [ ] Bedtime is appropriate for baby's age (typically 6:30-7:30 PM)

**Parent Readiness:**
- [ ] Partner is 100% committed to the plan
- [ ] You've discussed and agreed on the approach
- [ ] Support system is in place (someone to call if you need encouragement)
- [ ] No travel or major disruptions planned for next 2 weeks
- [ ] You're mentally prepared for difficult nights
- [ ] You understand this is temporary (3-7 days)

**Night Weaning Plan:**
- [ ] Decided whether to eliminate all night feeds or keep one
- [ ] If keeping one feed, you know exactly when (10-11 PM typically)
- [ ] Plan for how to handle night wakings without feeding

If you can't check every box, spend a few more days getting ready. Starting before you're prepared will make the process harder and longer.

### Perfecting Your Bedtime Routine

Your bedtime routine is crucial. It signals to your baby's brain that sleep is coming and helps them wind down naturally.

**Timing:** Start your routine 20-30 minutes before you want your baby asleep. If bedtime is 7:00 PM, start at 6:30 PM.

**Consistency:** Follow the exact same order every single night. No exceptions.

**Sample Routine:**
1. Bath (5-10 minutes, warm not hot)
2. Gentle massage with lotion (2-3 minutes)
3. Put on pajamas and sleep sack (2 minutes)
4. Feed (10-15 minutes, but NOT to sleep)
5. Read 1-2 books (5 minutes)
6. Sing lullaby or play soft music (2-3 minutes)
7. Say goodnight phrase: "I love you. Time to sleep. See you in the morning."
8. Put in crib awake, leave room

**Key Points:**
- Feed should be at the BEGINNING of the routine, not right before bed
- Baby should be drowsy but clearly awake when you put them down
- Keep the routine calm and boring—no exciting play
- Dim the lights during the routine
- Use the same goodnight phrase every night

Practice this routine for 3-7 nights before starting cry-it-out. Your baby needs to know what to expect.

## The Night-by-Night CIO Protocol

Now let's get into the specifics. Here's exactly what to do each night.

### Night 1: The Hardest Night

**Preparation:**
- Have a normal day with normal naps (don't skip naps to make baby extra tired—this backfires)
- If doing solids, give dinner early (5:00-5:30 PM)
- Start bedtime routine at your planned time
- Stay calm and confident—your baby can sense your emotions

**Execution:**

1. Complete your bedtime routine exactly as practiced
2. Put your baby in the crib drowsy but awake
3. Say your goodnight phrase: "I love you. Time to sleep. See you in the morning."
4. Leave the room and close the door
5. Turn on your video monitor
6. DO NOT RETURN until morning (6:00 AM minimum)

**What to Expect:**

Your baby will cry. This is normal and expected. Here's what typical Night 1 looks like:

- **Crying duration:** 20-90 minutes (average is 45 minutes)
- **Crying pattern:** May be continuous or come in waves
- **Physical activity:** Baby may stand, sit, roll around, move all over the crib
- **Vomiting:** Rare, but possible (more on this later)
- **Eventually:** Your baby will fall asleep

**What You'll See on the Monitor:**

Your baby will try different things: crying, standing, sitting, lying down, standing again. They're problem-solving. They're learning. This is good.

**Parent Survival Strategies:**

- Take turns monitoring the video—don't both watch the whole time
- One parent can leave the house if needed (go for a walk, sit in the car)
- Use headphones or white noise for yourself
- Remind yourself: "This is temporary. This is safe. This works."
- Track the time—it feels longer than it actually is
- Call your support person if you need encouragement

**Night Wakings:**

When your baby wakes at 2 AM or 4 AM, apply the exact same protocol: Don't go in. They will cry, and they will fall back asleep. This is how they learn to self-soothe at night.

**Exceptions (When to Intervene):**

Only enter the room if:
- Baby vomits (clean up quickly with minimal interaction, put back in crib, leave)
- Baby gets a limb stuck in crib slats (free them, put back down, leave)
- Diaper blowout (quick change, no talking, back in crib, leave)
- Fever or signs of illness (pause sleep training)

### Night 2-3: The Extinction Burst

**What Happens:**

This is where many parents give up, so listen carefully: Night 2 or 3 is often HARDER than Night 1. This is called an "extinction burst."

Your baby is escalating their protest to see if you'll come back. They're testing whether the rules have really changed. This is normal psychology—it happens with any behavior change.

**What to Expect:**

- Crying may increase in duration or intensity
- Baby may cry longer than Night 1
- You'll question whether this is working (it is!)
- You'll be tempted to give in (don't!)

**Critical Rule:**

DO NOT GIVE IN. If you go in on Night 2 or 3, you've just taught your baby that if they cry long enough and hard enough, you'll come back. This makes everything worse and you'll have to start over.

**Execution:**

Follow the exact same protocol as Night 1:
- Complete bedtime routine
- Put baby down awake
- Say goodnight phrase
- Leave room
- Don't return until morning
- Apply same method to night wakings

**Typical Timeline:**
- Night 2: 30-60 minutes crying
- Night 3: 20-45 minutes crying (or sometimes more—extinction burst)

**Stay Strong:**

Remember: This is the hardest part. Night 4 is typically the breakthrough. You're almost there.

### Night 4-5: The Breakthrough

**What Happens:**

This is when you see dramatic improvement. The crying drops significantly, and you finally see that this is working.

**What to Expect:**

- Crying decreases to 10-30 minutes
- Baby falls asleep faster
- Fewer night wakings (or sleeping through)
- You feel hopeful and relieved

**Execution:**

Continue the exact same approach:
- Same bedtime routine
- Same goodnight phrase
- Same protocol for night wakings
- No changes, no check-ins

**Celebrate Privately:**

You're seeing progress! But don't celebrate in front of your baby or change your approach. Stay consistent.

### Night 6-7: Success

**What Happens:**

By now, most babies are sleeping through the night or waking only briefly and self-soothing back to sleep.

**What to Expect:**

- Minimal crying at bedtime (5-10 minutes or none)
- Sleeping 10-12 hours straight (or close to it)
- Baby falls asleep within 10-15 minutes
- Independent sleep achieved!

**Execution:**

Keep doing exactly what you've been doing. Don't change anything just because it's working.

**Congratulations:**

You did it! Your family is transformed. The hard nights are behind you.

---

## Handling Night Wakings

Night wakings are handled the same way as bedtime: you don't go in.

**Protocol:**

When your baby wakes at 2 AM, 4 AM, or any time before your designated wake time (6 AM minimum):
- Monitor via video/audio
- Do not enter the room
- Baby will cry, then self-soothe back to sleep
- This is how they learn to connect sleep cycles

**Timeline:**

Night wakings typically resolve 2-3 days after bedtime improves. So if your baby is falling asleep independently at bedtime by Night 4, expect night wakings to resolve by Night 6-7.

**Night Weaning:**

If you're eliminating night feeds (recommended for babies 6+ months with pediatrician approval):

**Cold Turkey Approach (Recommended):**
- No feeds starting Night 1
- All wakings handled with no intervention
- Fastest and most effective
- Baby adjusts within 3-5 nights

**Keeping One Feed (Alternative):**
- Choose a consistent time (10-11 PM typically)
- Feed quickly with minimal interaction
- Put baby back in crib awake
- Eliminate this feed after 3-5 nights

**Partner Strategy:**

If you're breastfeeding and finding it hard not to feed at night, have your partner handle all night wakings. Baby is less likely to expect feeding if they don't smell milk.

## Troubleshooting Common CIO Issues

Even with perfect preparation, you may encounter challenges. Here's how to handle them.

### Issue 1: "Baby Cried for 2+ Hours on Night 1"

**Possible Causes:**
- Baby is overtired (wake windows too long, bedtime too late)
- Baby is undertired (too much daytime sleep, bedtime too early)
- Room isn't dark enough
- Baby can sense you hovering outside the door

**Solutions:**
- Check your schedule: Are wake windows age-appropriate?
- Verify bedtime is right for your baby's age (typically 6:30-7:30 PM)
- Make sure room is pitch black
- Stay away from the door—baby can hear and smell you
- Continue with Night 2—it will likely be better

**Important:** Even if Night 1 was rough, continue. Don't give up after one night.

### Issue 2: "Baby Vomited from Crying"

**Why It Happens:**

Some babies (especially younger ones or those with sensitive gag reflexes) vomit when crying hard. This is more common if they've recently eaten.

**What to Do:**

1. Enter the room calmly
2. Clean up quickly and efficiently
3. Change sheets/pajamas if needed
4. NO talking, NO eye contact, NO comforting beyond what's necessary
5. Put baby back in crib immediately
6. Leave the room
7. Continue sleep training

**Prevention:**

- Feed earlier in the bedtime routine (not right before bed)
- Smaller bedtime feed if needed
- Most babies don't repeat this behavior

**Important:** Vomiting doesn't mean you should stop sleep training. It's rare and usually doesn't happen again.

### Issue 3: "Crying Increased on Night 2-3 (Extinction Burst)"

**Why It Happens:**

This is normal psychology. Your baby is escalating to see if the rules have really changed. It's called an extinction burst and it's actually a sign that sleep training is working.

**What to Do:**

- Expect this and don't panic
- Stay consistent—don't give in
- Remind yourself: "This is normal. Night 4 will be better."
- Don't change your approach
- Don't do check-ins or try to "help"

**Critical:**

Giving in during the extinction burst teaches your baby that if they cry long enough and hard enough, you'll come back. This makes everything worse. Stay strong.

### Issue 4: "Worked for 3 Days, Then Baby Regressed"

**Possible Causes:**
- Illness or teething
- Travel or schedule disruption
- You gave in once (even briefly)
- Schedule needs adjustment

**Solutions:**

**If Illness:**
- Pause sleep training
- Provide comfort as needed
- Resume immediately when healthy (usually just 1-2 nights to re-establish)

**If You Gave In:**
- Start over from Night 1
- Commit to consistency this time
- Remember: One intervention can undo days of progress

**If Schedule Issue:**
- Reassess wake windows and bedtime
- Adjust if needed
- Continue with consistency

### Issue 5: "Partner Wants to Give Up"

**Why It Happens:**

Hearing your baby cry is hard. Your partner may be doubting the method or feeling like it's not working.

**How to Handle:**

- Review the research together
- Look at your tracking sheet—even small improvements are progress
- Remind each other of the timeline (breakthrough typically happens Night 4)
- Take turns monitoring so one person can get a break
- One partner can leave the house if needed
- Remind yourselves: "3-7 days of crying vs years of sleep deprivation"
- Support each other—you're a team

**Critical:**

You must stay united. If one parent is doing CIO and the other is going in to comfort, your baby will be confused and progress will stall.

### Issue 6: "Neighbors Are Complaining (Apartment Living)"

**Solutions:**

**Before Starting:**
- Give neighbors a heads-up
- Explain it's temporary (3-7 days)
- Offer a small gift or apology note
- Share your timeline

**During Sleep Training:**
- White noise in baby's room (helps contain sound)
- Rugs or carpets (absorb sound)
- Weather stripping on doors
- Start on a weekend when neighbors may be more tolerant

**If Complaints Continue:**
- Apologize and reiterate it's temporary
- Most neighbors understand once they know the timeline
- Consider whether you can temporarily stay elsewhere (grandparents)

**Alternative:**

If apartment living makes CIO too difficult, consider a gentler method (Module 6) that involves less crying.

- Confidence building

### Handling Future Disruptions

Life happens. Here's how to handle common disruptions without losing your progress.

**Illness:**
- Provide comfort as needed during illness
- Return to normal routine immediately when healthy
- May need 1-2 nights to re-establish (not a full restart)
- Don't create new sleep associations

**Travel:**
- Maintain bedtime routine as much as possible
- Bring white noise machine and blackout curtains (portable ones)
- Expect 1-2 rough nights upon return home
- Re-establish quickly with consistency

**Sleep Regressions:**
- Occur around 8 months, 12 months, 18 months
- Related to developmental leaps
- Maintain consistency through regression
- Don't revert to old habits
- Lasts 2-4 weeks if handled correctly

**Daylight Saving Time:**
- Adjust schedule gradually (15 minutes per day for 4 days)
- Or go cold turkey (works for most babies)
- Maintain bedtime routine

**Teething:**
- Give pain relief 30 minutes before bed if needed
- Don't create new sleep associations
- One night of extra comfort, then back to normal
- True teething pain doesn't last weeks

---

## When to Seek Additional Help

CIO works for most families, but sometimes you need extra support.

**Seek help if:**
- No improvement after 14 days of perfect consistency
- Crying is increasing instead of decreasing
- You suspect medical issues (sleep apnea, reflux, severe allergies)
- Baby's crying seems distressed rather than protesting (high-pitched, inconsolable)
- Your mental health is suffering
- Your relationship is suffering

**Resources:**
- Pediatric sleep consultant for personalized guidance
- Your pediatrician to rule out medical issues
- Therapist if you're experiencing severe anxiety or depression

There's no shame in asking for help.
