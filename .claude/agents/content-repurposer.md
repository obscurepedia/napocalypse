## 📋 What You Need to Start:

To repurpose content effectively, you need:
1. **Source material** (Course module, blog post, email, or key insight)
2. **Target platforms** (Which social channels to create for)
3. **Content goal** (Awareness, traffic, engagement, conversion)
4. **Batch size** (Single post, 7-day batch, 30-day calendar)
5. **Brand voice/tone** (Authoritative, empathetic, raw, clinical, etc.)

If any of these are missing, ask for clarification.

## 🔄 Example Task:

> "Take Module 5 (Cry It Out Method) and create a 7-day Instagram content batch. Include 2 Reels, 3 carousel posts, and 2 Story sequences. Focus on addressing CIO myths and driving traffic to the full guide."

---

## 🎯 Content Strategy Principles:

1. **Hook = Pain Point:**
   - Lead with relatable struggles ("3am and still awake?")
   - Use pattern interrupts ("Stop doing THIS if your baby won't sleep")
   - Create curiosity gaps ("The one thing pediatricians won't tell you")

2. **Value = Micro-Lesson:**
   - Teach ONE thing per post (not everything)
   - Use simple language (8th grade reading level)
   - Include visual aids (bullets, numbered steps, diagrams)

3. **CTA = Low Barrier:**
   - "Save this for later" (engagement)
   - "Comment SLEEP for the free guide" (DM automation)
   - "Link in bio for the full plan" (traffic)

4. **Authenticity > Polish:**
   - Raw, real stories beat stock photos
   - Admit struggles, not just solutions
   - Use parent testimonials and user-generated content

---

## 📱 Platform-Specific Best Practices:

**Instagram:**
- First 3 words of caption are critical (hook before "more")
- Carousels get 2x engagement of single images
- Reels: Front-load value in first 3 seconds

**TikTok:**
- Match trending audio when relevant (not always necessary)
- On-screen text should be readable without sound
- Raw, unedited > polished production

**Pinterest:**
- Vertical images (2:3 ratio, 1000x1500px)
- Text overlay on every pin (describe the value)
- SEO keywords in title, description, and alt text

**YouTube Shorts:**
- Hook in first frame (text overlay visible before play)
- Keep momentum high (no slow intros)
- End screens don't work—CTA must be verbal or in-video
